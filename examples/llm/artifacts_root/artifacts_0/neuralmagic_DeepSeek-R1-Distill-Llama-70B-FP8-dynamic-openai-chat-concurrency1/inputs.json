yet set down this day of triumph Tomorrow in my judgement is too sudden For I myself am not so well provided As else I would be were the day prolonged Enter Bishop of Ely ELY Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester I have sent for these strawberries HASTINGS His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning Theres some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit I think theres never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he For by his face straight shall you know his heart STANLEY What of his heart perceive you in his face By any livelihood he showed today HASTINGS Marry that with no man here he is offended For were he he had shown it in his looks Enter Richard and Buckingham RICHARD I pray you all tell me what they deserve That do conspire my death with devilish plots Of damned witchcraft and that have prevailed Upon my body with their hellish charms HASTINGS The tender love I bear your Grace my lord Makes me most forward in this princely presence To doom th offenders whosoeer they be I say my lord they have deserved death RICHARD Then be your eyes the witness of their evil Look how I am bewitched Behold mine arm Is like a blasted sapling withered up And this is Edwards wife that monstrous witch Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore That by their witchcraft thus have marked me HASTINGS If they have done this deed my noble lord RICHARD If Thou protector of this damned strumpet Talkst thou to me of ifs Thou art a traitor Off with his head Now by Saint Paul I swear I will not dine until I see the same Lovell and Ratcliffe look that it be done The rest that love me rise and follow me Exeunt all but Lovell and Ratcliffe with the Lord Hastings HASTINGS Woe woe for England Not a whit for me For I

great preservation We live to tell it that the subtle traitor This day had plotted in the councilhouse To murder me and my good lord of Gloucester MAYOR Had he done so RICHARD What think you we are Turks or Infidels Or that we would against the form of law Proceed thus rashly in the villains death But that the extreme peril of the case The peace of England and our persons safety Enforced us to this execution MAYOR Now fair befall you He deserved his death And your good Graces both have well proceeded To warn false traitors from the like attempts BUCKINGHAM I never looked for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore Yet had we not determined he should die Until your lordship came to see his end Which now the loving haste of these our friends Something against our meanings have prevented Because my lord we would have had you heard The traitor speak and timorously confess The manner and the purpose of his treasons That you might well have signified the same Unto the citizens who haply may Misconster us in him and wail his death MAYOR But my good lord your Graces word shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak And do not doubt right noble princes

Guildhall hies him in all post There at your meetst advantage of the time Infer the bastardy of Edwards children Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen Only for saying he would make his son Heir to the Crownmeaning indeed his house Which by the sign thereof was termed so Moreover urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust Which stretched unto their servants daughters wives Even where his raging eye or savage heart Without control lusted to make a prey Nay for a need thus far come near my person Tell them when that my mother went with child Of that insatiate Edward noble York My princely father then had wars in France And by true computation of the time Found that the issue was not his begot Which well appeared in his lineaments Being nothing like the noble Duke my father Yet touch this sparingly as twere far off Because my lord you know my mother lives BUCKINGHAM Doubt not my lord Ill play the orator As if the golden fee for which I plead Were for myself And so my lord adieu RICHARD If you thrive well bring them to Baynards Castle Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and welllearned bishops BUCKINGHAM I go and towards three or four oclock Look for the news that the Guildhall affords Exit RICHARD Go Lovell with all speed to Doctor Shaa To Ratcliffe Go thou to Friar Penker bid them both Meet me within this hour at Baynards Castle Exeunt Ratcliffe and Lovell Now will I go to take some privy order To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight And to give order that no manner person Have any time recourse unto the Princes Exit SCENE VI London A street Enter a Scrivener SCRIVENER Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings Which in a set hand fairly is engrossed That it may be today read oer in Pauls And mark how well the sequel hangs together Eleven hours I have spent to write it over For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me The precedent was full as long adoing And yet within these five hours Hastings lived Untainted unexamined free at liberty Heres a good world the while Who is so gross That cannot see this palpable device Yet who so bold but says he sees it not Bad is the world and all will come to naught When such ill dealing must be seen in thought Exit SCENE VII London Court of Baynards Castle Enter Richard and Buckingham at several doors RICHARD How now how now What say the citizens BUCKINGHAM Now by the holy mother of our Lord The citizens are mum say not a word RICHARD Touched you the bastardy of Edwards children BUCKINGHAM I did with his contract with Lady Lucy And his contract by deputy in France Th insatiate greediness of his desire And his enforcement of the city wives His tyranny for trifles his own bastardy As being got your father then in France And his resemblance being not like the Duke Withal I did infer your lineaments Being the right idea of your father Both in your form and nobleness of mind Laid open all your victories in Scotland Your discipline in war wisdom in peace Your bounty virtue fair humility Indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose Untouched or slightly handled in discourse And when mine oratory drew toward end I bid them that did love their countrys good Cry God save Richard Englands royal King RICHARD And did they so BUCKINGHAM No so God help me they spake not a word But like dumb statues or breathing stones Stared each on other and looked deadly pale Which when I saw I reprehended them And asked the Mayor what meant this wilful silence His answer was the people were not used To be spoke to but by the Recorder Then he was urged to tell my tale again Thus saith the Duke thus hath the Duke inferred But nothing spoke in warrant from himself When he had done some followers of mine own At lower end of the hall hurled up their caps And some ten voices cried God save King Richard And thus I took the vantage of those few Thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth I This general applause and cheerful shout Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard And even here brake off and came away RICHARD What tongueless blocks were they Would they not speak Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come BUCKINGHAM The mayor is here at hand Intend some fear Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit And look you get a prayerbook in your hand And stand between two churchmen good my lord For on that ground Ill make a holy descant And be not easily won to our requests Play the maids part still answer nay and take it RICHARD I go and if you plead as well for them As I can say nay to thee for myself No doubt we bring it to a happy issue BUCKINGHAM Go go up to the leads the Lord Mayor knocks Exit Richard Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens Welcome my lord I dance attendance here I think the Duke will not be spoke withal Enter Catesby Now Catesby what says your lord to my request CATESBY He doth entreat your Grace my noble lord To visit him tomorrow or next day He is within with two right reverend fathers Divinely bent to meditation And in no worldly suits would he be moved To draw him from his holy exercise BUCKINGHAM Return good Catesby to the gracious Duke Tell him myself the Mayor and aldermen In deep designs in matter of great moment No less importing than our general good Are come to have some conference with his Grace CATESBY Ill signify so much unto him straight Exit BUCKINGHAM Ah ha my lord this prince is not an Edward He is not lolling on a lewd lovebed But on his knees at meditation Not dallying with a brace of courtesans But meditating with two deep divines Not sleeping to engross his idle body But praying to enrich his watchful soul Happy were England would this virtuous prince Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof But sure I fear we shall not win him to it MAYOR Marry God defend his Grace should say us nay BUCKINGHAM I fear he will Here Catesby comes again Enter Catesby Now Catesby what says his Grace CATESBY He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him His Grace not being warned thereof before He fears my lord you mean no good to him BUCKINGHAM Sorry I am my noble cousin should Suspect me that I mean no good to him By heaven we come to him in perfect love And so once more return and tell his Grace Exit Catesby When holy and devout religious men Are at their beads tis much to draw them thence So sweet is zealous contemplation Enter Richard aloft between two Bishops Catesby reenters MAYOR See where his Grace stands tween two clergymen BUCKINGHAM Two props of virtue for a Christian prince To stay him from the fall of vanity And see"

affections in his charmed power Reservd the stalk and gave him all my flower Yet did I not as some my equals did Demand of him nor being desired yielded Finding myself in honour so forbid With safest distance I mine honour shielded Experience for me many bulwarks builded Of proofs newbleeding which remaind the foil Of this false jewel and his amorous spoil But ah Who ever shunnd by precedent The destind ill she must herself assay Or forced examples gainst her own content To put the bypassd perils in her way Counsel may stop a while what will not stay For when we rage advice is often seen By blunting us to make our wills more keen Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood That we must curb it upon others proof To be forbode the sweets that seems so good For fear of harms that preach in our behoof O appetite from judgement stand aloof The one a palate hath that needs will taste Though reason weep and cry It is thy last For further I could say This mans untrue And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling Heard where his plants in others orchards grew Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling Thought characters and words merely but art And bastards of his foul adulterate heart And long upon these terms I held my city Till thus he gan besiege me Gentle maid Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity And be not of my holy vows afraid Thats to ye sworn to none was ever said For feasts of love I have been calld unto Till now did neer invite nor never woo All my offences that abroad you see Are errors of the blood none of the mind Love made them not with acture they may be Where neither party is nor true nor kind They sought their shame that so their shame did find And so much less of shame in me remains By how much of me their reproach contains Among the many that mine eyes have seen Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed Or my affection put to th smallest teen Or any of my leisures ever charmed Harm have I done to them but neer was harmed Kept hearts in liveries but mine own was free And reignd commanding in his monarchy Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me Of pallid pearls and rubies red as blood Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me Of grief and blushes aptly understood In bloodless white and the encrimsond mood Effects of terror and dear modesty Encampd in hearts but fighting outwardly And lo behold these talents of their hair With twisted metal amorously empleachd I have receivd from many a several fair Their kind acceptance weepingly beseechd With th annexions of fair gems enrichd And deepbraind sonnets that did amplify Each stones dear nature worth and quality The diamond why twas beautiful and hard Whereto his invisd properties did tend The deep green emerald in whose fresh regard Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend The heavenhued sapphire and the opal blend With objects manifold each several stone With wit well blazond smild or made some moan Lo all these trophies of affections hot Of pensivd and subdued desires the tender Nature hath chargd me that I hoard them not But yield them up where I myself must render That is to you my origin and ender For these of force must your oblations be Since I their altar you empatron me O then advance of yours that phraseless hand Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise Take all these similes to your own command Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise What me your minister for you obeys Works under you and to your audit comes Their distract parcels in combined sums Lo this device was sent me from a nun Or sister sanctified of holiest note Which late her noble suit in court did shun Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote For she was sought by spirits of richest coat But kept cold distance and did thence remove To spend her living in eternal love But O my sweet what labour ist to leave The thing we have not mastring what not strives Planing the place which did no form receive Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves She that her fame so to herself contrives The scars of battle scapeth by the flight And makes her absence valiant not her might O pardon me in that my boast is true The accident which brought me to her eye Upon the moment did her force subdue And now she would the caged cloister fly Religious love put out religions eye Not to be tempted would she be immurd And now to tempt all liberty procurd How mighty then you are O hear me tell The broken bosoms that to me belong Have emptied all their fountains in my well And mine I pour your ocean all among I strong oer them and you oer me being strong Must for your victory us all congest As compound love to physic your cold breast My parts had powr to charm a sacred nun Who disciplind and dieted in grace Believd her eyes when they tassail begun All vows and consecrations giving place O most potential love Vow bond nor space In thee hath neither sting knot nor confine For thou art all and all things else are thine When thou impressest what are precepts worth Of stale example When thou wilt inflame How coldly those impediments stand forth Of wealth of filial fear law kindred fame Loves arms are peace gainst rule gainst sense gainst shame And sweetens in the suffring pangs it bears The aloes of all forces shocks and fears Now all these hearts that do on mine depend Feeling it break with bleeding groans they pine And supplicant their sighs to your extend To leave the battry that you make gainst mine Lending soft audience to my sweet design And credent soul to that strongbonded oath That shall prefer and undertake my troth This said his watry eyes he did dismount Whose sights till then were levelld on my face Each cheek a river running from a fount With brinish current downward flowed apace O how the channel to the stream gave grace Who glazd with crystal gate the glowing roses That flame through water which their hue encloses O father what a hell of witchcraft lies In the small orb of one particular tear But with the inundation of the eyes What rocky heart to water will not wear What breast so cold that is not warmed here O cleft effect Cold modesty hot wrath Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath For lo his passion but an art of craft Even there resolvd my reason into tears There my white stole of chastity I daffd Shook off my sober guards and civil fears Appear to him as he to me appears All melting though our drops this diffrence bore His poisond me and mine did him restore In him a plenitude of subtle matter Applied to cautels all strange forms receives Of burning blushes or of weeping water Or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves In eithers aptness as it best deceives To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows That not a heart which in his level came Could scape the hail of his allhurting aim Showing fair nature is both kind and tame And veild in them did win whom he would maim Against the thing he sought he would exclaim When he most burned in heartwishd luxury He preachd pure maid and praisd cold chastity Thus merely with the garment of a grace The naked and concealed fiend he coverd That thunexperient gave the tempter place Which like a cherubin above them hoverd Who young and simple would not be so loverd Ay me I fell and yet do question make What I should do again for such a sake O that infected moisture of his eye O that false fire which in his cheek so glowd O that forcd thunder from his heart did fly O that sad breath his spongy lungs bestowd O all that borrowed motion seeming owed Would yet again betray the forebetrayed And new pervert a reconciled maid THE PASSIONATE PILGRIM I When my love swears that she is made of truth I do believe her though I know she lies That she might think me some untutord youth Unskilful in the worlds false forgeries Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young Although I know my years be past the best I smiling credit her falsespeaking tongue Outfacing faults in love with loves ill rest But wherefore says my love that she is young And wherefore say not I that I am old O loves best habit is a soothing tongue And age in love loves not to have years told Therefore Ill lie with love and love with me Since that our faults in love thus smotherd be II Two loves I have of comfort and despair That like two spirits do suggest me still My better angel is a man right fair My worser spirit a woman colourd ill To win me soon to hell my female evil Tempteth my better angel from my side And would corrupt my saint to be a devil Wooing his purity with her fair pride And whether that my angel be turnd fiend Suspect I may yet not directly tell For being both to me both to each friend I guess one angel in anothers hell The truth I shall not know but live in doubt Till my bad angel fire my good one out III Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye Gainst whom the world could not hold argument Persuade my heart to this false perjury Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment A woman I forswore but I will prove Thou being a goddess I forswore not thee My vow was earthly thou a heavenly love Thy grace being gaind cures all disgrace in me My vow was breath and breath a vapour is Then thou fair sun that on this earth doth shine Exhale this vapour vow in thee it is If broken then it is no fault of mine If by me broke what fool is not so wise To break an oath to win a paradise IV Sweet Cytherea sitting by a brook With young Adonis lovely fresh and green Did court the lad with many a lovely look Such looks as none could look but beautys queen She told him stories to delight his ear She showd him favours to allure his eye To win his heart she touchd him here and there Touches so soft still conquer chastity But whether unripe years did want conceit Or he refusd to take her figurd proffer The tender nibbler would not touch the bait But smile and jest at every gentle offer Then fell she on her back fair queen and toward He rose and ran away ah fool too froward V If love make me forsworn how shall I swear to love O never faith could hold if not to beauty vowed Though to myself forsworn to thee Ill constant prove Those thoughts to me like oaks to thee like osiers bowed Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend If knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire Thine eye Joves lightning seems thy voice his dreadful thunder Which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire Celestial as thou art O do not love that wrong To sing heavens praise with such an earthly tongue VI Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade When Cytherea all in love forlorn A longing tarriance for Adonis made Under an osier growing by a brook A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen Hot was the day she hotter that did look For his approach that often there had been Anon he comes and throws his mantle by And stood stark naked on the brooks green brim The sun lookd on the world with glorious eye Yet not so wistly as this queen on him He spying her bouncd in whereas he stood O Jove quoth she why was not I a flood VII Fair is my love but not so fair as fickle Mild as a dove but neither true nor trusty Brighter than glass and yet as glass is brittle Softer than wax and yet as iron rusty A lily pale with damask dye to grace her None fairer nor none falser to deface her Her lips to mine how often hath she joined Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing How many tales to please me hath she coined Dreading my love the loss thereof still fearing Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings Her faith her oaths her tears and all were jestings She burnt with love as straw with fire flameth She burnt out love as soon as straw outburneth She framd the love and yet she foild the framing She bade love last and yet she fell aturning Was this a lover or a lecher whether Bad in the best though excellent in neither VIII If music and sweet poetry agree As they must needs the sister and the brother Then must the love be great twixt thee and me Because thou lovst the one and I the other Dowland to thee is dear whose heavenly touch Upon the lute doth ravish human sense Spenser to me whose deep conceit is such As passing all conceit needs no defence Thou lovst to hear the sweet melodious sound That Phbus lute the queen of music makes And I in deep delight am chiefly drownd Whenas himself to singing he betakes One god is god of both as poets feign One knight loves both and both in thee remain IX Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love Paler for sorrow than her milkwhite dove For Adons sake a youngster proud and wild Her stand she takes upon a steepup hill Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds She silly queen with more than loves good will Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds Once quoth she did I see a fair sweet youth Here in these brakes deepwounded with a boar Deep in the thigh a spectacle of ruth See in my thigh quoth she here was the sore She showed hers he saw more wounds than one And blushing fled and left her all alone X Sweet rose fair flower untimely pluckd soon vaded Pluckd"

thee ROSALIND They say you are a melancholy fellow JAQUES I am so I do love it better than laughing ROSALIND Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards JAQUES Why tis good to be sad and say nothing ROSALIND Why then tis good to be a post JAQUES I have neither the scholars melancholy which is emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical nor the courtiers which is proud nor the soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness ROSALIND A traveller By my faith you have great reason to be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands JAQUES Yes I have gained my experience ROSALIND And your experience makes you sad I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sadand to travel for it too Enter Orlando ORLANDO Good day and happiness dear Rosalind JAQUES Nay then God be wi you an you talk in blank verse ROSALIND Farewell Monsieur Traveller Look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola Exit Jaques Why how now Orlando where have you been all this while You a lover An you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more ORLANDO My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise ROSALIND Break an hours promise in love He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o the shoulder but Ill warrant him heartwhole ORLANDO Pardon me dear Rosalind ROSALIND Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I had as lief be wooed of a snail ORLANDO Of a snail ROSALIND Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his heada better jointure I think than you make a woman Besides he brings his destiny with him ORLANDO Whats that ROSALIND Why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife ORLANDO Virtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuous ROSALIND And I am your Rosalind CELIA It pleases him to call you so but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you ROSALIND Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent What would you say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind ORLANDO I would kiss before I spoke ROSALIND Nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lackingGod warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss ORLANDO How if the kiss be denied ROSALIND Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter ORLANDO Who could be out being before his beloved mistress ROSALIND Marry that should you if I were your mistress or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit ORLANDO What of my suit ROSALIND Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit Am not I your Rosalind ORLANDO I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her ROSALIND Well in her person I say I will not have you ORLANDO Then in mine own person I die ROSALIND No faith die by attorney The poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a lovecause Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love Leander he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos But these are all lies Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love ORLANDO I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind for I protest her frown might kill me ROSALIND By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now I will be your Rosalind in a more comingon disposition and ask me what you will I will grant it ORLANDO Then love me Rosalind ROSALIND Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all ORLANDO And wilt thou have me ROSALIND Ay and twenty such ORLANDO What sayest thou ROSALIND Are you not good ORLANDO I hope so ROSALIND Why then can one desire too much of a good thingCome sister you shall be the priest and marry usGive me your hand OrlandoWhat do you say sister ORLANDO Pray thee marry us CELIA I cannot say the words ROSALIND You must begin Will you Orlando CELIA Go toWill you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind ORLANDO I will ROSALIND Ay but when ORLANDO Why now as fast as she can marry us ROSALIND Then you must say I take thee Rosalind for wife ORLANDO I take thee Rosalind for wife ROSALIND I might ask you for your commission But I do take thee Orlando for my husband Theres a girl goes before the priest and certainly a womans thought runs before her actions ORLANDO So do all thoughts They are winged ROSALIND Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her ORLANDO For ever and a day ROSALIND Say a day without the ever No no Orlando men are April when they woo December when they wed Maids are May when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cockpigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey I will weep for nothing like Diana in the fountain and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry I will laugh like a hyena and that when thou are inclined to sleep ORLANDO But will my Rosalind do so ROSALIND By my life she will do as I do ORLANDO O but she is wise ROSALIND Or else she could not have the wit to do this The wiser the waywarder Make the doors upon a womans wit and it will out at the casement Shut that and twill out at the keyhole Stop that twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney ORLANDO A man that had a wife with such a wit he might say Wit whither wilt ROSALIND Nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed ORLANDO And what wit could wit have to excuse that ROSALIND Marry to say she came to seek you there You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue O that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool ORLANDO For these two hours Rosalind I will leave thee ROSALIND Alas dear love I cannot lack thee two hours ORLANDO I must attend the Duke at dinner By two oclock I will be with thee again ROSALIND Ay go your ways go your ways I knew what you would prove My friends told me as much and I thought no less That flattering tongue of yours won me Tis but one cast away and so come death Two oclock is your hour ORLANDO Ay sweet Rosalind ROSALIND By my troth and in good earnest and so God mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour I will think you the most pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful Therefore beware my censure and keep your promise ORLANDO With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind So adieu ROSALIND Well Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let time try Adieu Exit Orlando CELIA You have simply misused our sex in your loveprate We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest ROSALIND O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love But it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the Bay of Portugal CELIA Or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection in it runs out ROSALIND No that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses everyones eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep I am in love Ill tell thee Aliena I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando Ill go find a shadow and sigh till he come CELIA And Ill sleep Exeunt SCENE II Another part of the Forest Enter Jaques and Lords like foresters JAQUES Which is he that killed the deer FIRST LORD Sir it was I JAQUES Lets present him to the Duke like a Roman conqueror and it would do well to set the deers horns upon his head for a branch of victory Have you no song forester for this purpose SECOND LORD Yes sir JAQUES Sing it Tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enough SONG SECOND LORD Sings What shall he have that killed the deer His leather skin and horns to wear Then sing him home The rest shall bear this burden Take thou no scorn to wear the horn It was a crest ere thou wast born Thy fathers father wore it And thy father bore it The horn the horn the lusty horn Is not a thing to laugh to scorn Exeunt SCENE III Another part of the Forest Enter Rosalind and Celia ROSALIND How say you now Is it not past two oclock And here much Orlando CELIA I warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he hath taen his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep Enter Silvius Look who comes here SILVIUS My errand is to you fair youth My gentle Phoebe did bid me give you this Giving a letter I know not the contents but as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she did use as she was writing of it It bears an angry tenor Pardon me I am but as a guiltless messenger ROSALIND Patience herself would startle at this letter And play the swaggerer Bear this bear all She says I am not fair that I lack manners She calls me proud and that she could not love me Were man as rare as phoenix Ods my will Her love is not the hare that I do hunt Why writes she so to me Well shepherd well This is a letter of your own device SILVIUS No I protest I know not the contents Phoebe did write it ROSALIND Come come you are a fool And turned into the extremity of love I saw her hand She has a leathern hand A freestonecoloured hand I verily did think That her old gloves were on but twas her hands She has a huswifes handbut thats no matter I say she never did invent this letter This is a mans invention and his hand SILVIUS Sure it is hers ROSALIND Why tis a boisterous and a cruel style A style for challengers Why she defies me Like Turk to Christian Womens gentle brain Could not drop forth such giantrude invention Such Ethiop words blacker in their effect Than in their countenance Will you hear the letter SILVIUS So please you for I never heard it yet Yet heard too much of Phoebes cruelty ROSALIND She Phoebes me Mark how the tyrant writes Reads Art thou god to shepherd turned That a maidens heart hath burned Can a woman rail thus SILVIUS Call you this railing ROSALIND Why thy godhead laid apart Warrst thou with a womans heart Did you ever hear such railing Whiles the eye of man did woo me That could do no vengeance to me Meaning me a beast If the scorn of your bright eyne Have power to raise such love in mine Alack in me what strange effect Would they work in mild aspect Whiles you chid me I did love How then might your prayers move He that brings this love to thee Little knows this love in me And by him seal up thy mind Whether that thy youth and kind Will the faithful offer take Of me and all that I can make Or else by him my love deny And then Ill study how to die SILVIUS Call you this chiding CELIA Alas poor shepherd ROSALIND Do you pity him No he deserves no pityWilt thou love such a woman What to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee Not to be endured Well go your way to her for I see love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to her that if she love me I charge her to love thee if she will not I will never have her unless thou entreat for her If you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company Exit Silvius Enter Oliver OLIVER Good morrow fair ones Pray you if you know Where in the purlieus of this forest stands A sheepcote fenced about"

quarrel with fear and trembling DON PEDRO And so will he do for the man doth fear God howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make Well I am sorry for your niece Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love CLAUDIO Never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel LEONATO Nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first DON PEDRO Well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while I love Benedick well and I could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady LEONATO My lord will you walk dinner is ready CLAUDIO Aside If he do not dote on her upon this I will never trust my expectation DON PEDRO Aside Let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry The sport will be when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter thats the scene that I would see which will be merely a dumb show Let us send her to call him in to dinner Exeunt Don Pedro Claudio and Leonato BENEDICK Advancing from the arbour This can be no trick the conference was sadly borne They have the truth of this from Hero They seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent Love me why it must be requited I hear how I am censured they say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection I did never think to marry I must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending They say the lady is fair tis a truth I can bear them witness and virtuous tis so I cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for I will be horribly in love with her I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour No the world must be peopled When I said I would die a bachelor I did not think I should live till I were married Here comes Beatrice By this day shes a fair lady I do spy some marks of love in her Enter Beatrice BEATRICE Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner BENEDICK Fair Beatrice I thank you for your pains BEATRICE I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful I would not have come BENEDICK You take pleasure then in the message BEATRICE Yea just so much as you may take upon a knifes point and choke a daw withal You have no stomach signior fare you well Exit BENEDICK Ha Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner theres a double meaning in that I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me thats as much as to say Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks If I do not take pity of her I am a villain if I do not love her I am a Jew I will go get her picture Exit ACT III SCENE I Leonatos Garden Enter Hero Margaret and Ursula HERO Good Margaret run thee to the parlour There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursala Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse Is all of her say that thou overheardst us And bid her steal into the pleached bower Where honeysuckles ripend by the sun Forbid the sun to enter like favourites Made proud by princes that advance their pride Against that power that bred it There will she hide her To listen our propose This is thy office Bear thee well in it and leave us alone MARGARET Ill make her come I warrant you presently Exit HERO Now Ursula when Beatrice doth come As we do trace this alley up and down Our talk must only be of Benedick When I do name him let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice of this matter Is little Cupids crafty arrow made That only wounds by hearsay Enter Beatrice behind Now begin For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs Close by the ground to hear our conference URSULA The pleasantst angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream And greedily devour the treacherous bait So angle we for Beatrice who even now Is couched in the woodbine coverture Fear you not my part of the dialogue HERO Then go we near her that her ear lose nothing Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it They advance to the bower No truly Ursula she is too disdainful I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggards of the rock URSULA But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely HERO So says the Prince and my newtrothed lord URSULA And did they bid you tell her of it madam HERO They did entreat me to acquaint her of it But I persuaded them if they lovd Benedick To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it URSULA Why did you so Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon HERO O god of love I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man But Nature never framd a womans heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes Misprising what they look on and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak She cannot love Nor take no shape nor project of affection She is so selfendeard URSULA Sure I think so And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love lest she make sport at it HERO Why you speak truth I never yet saw man How wise how noble young how rarely featurd But she would spell him backward if fairfacd She would swear the gentleman should be her sister If black why Nature drawing of an antick Made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded If low an agate very vilely cut If speaking why a vane blown with all winds If silent why a block moved with none So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth URSULA Sure sure such carping is not commendable HERO No not to be so odd and from all fashions As Beatrice is cannot be commendable But who dare tell her so If I should speak She would mock me into air O she would laugh me Out of myself press me to

as to say the sweet youths in love DON PEDRO The greatest note of it is his melancholy CLAUDIO And when was he wont to wash his face DON PEDRO Yea or to paint himself for the which I hear what they

thine GLOUCESTER Be patient gentle Nell forget this grief ELEANOR Ah Gloucester teach me to forget myself For whilst I think I am thy married wife And thou a prince Protector of this land Methinks I should not thus be led along Mailed up in shame with papers on my back And followed with a rabble that rejoice To see my tears and hear my deepfet groans The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet And

King the Queen Cardinal Beaufort Suffolk York Buckingham Salisbury and Warwick to the Parliament KING HENRY I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man Whateer occasion keeps him from us now QUEEN MARGARET Can you not see or will ye not observe The strangeness of his altered countenance With what a majesty he bears himself How insolent of late he is become How proud how peremptory and unlike himself We know the time since he was mild and affable And if we did but glance a faroff look Immediately he was upon his knee That all the court admired him for submission But meet him now and be it in the morn When everyone will give the time of day He knits his brow and shows an angry eye And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee Disdaining duty that to us belongs Small curs are not regarded when they grin But great men tremble when the lion roars And Humphrey is no little man in England First note that he is near you in descent And should you fall he is the next will mount Me seemeth then it is no policy Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears And his advantage following your decease That he should come about your royal person Or be admitted to your Highness Council By flattery hath he won the commons hearts And when he please to make commotion Tis to be feared they all will follow him Now tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted Suffer them now and theyll oergrow the garden And choke the herbs for want of husbandry The reverent care I bear unto my lord Made me collect these dangers in the Duke If it be fond can it a womans fear Which fear if better reasons can supplant I will subscribe and say I wronged the Duke My Lord of Suffolk Buckingham and York Reprove my allegation if you can Or else conclude my words effectual SUFFOLK Well hath your highness seen into this Duke And had I first been put to speak my mind I think I should have told your graces tale The Duchess by his subornation Upon my life began her devilish practices Or if he were not privy to those faults Yet by reputing of his high descent As next the King he was successive heir And such high vaunts of his nobility Did instigate the bedlam brainsick Duchess By wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep And in his simple show he harbours treason The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb No no my sovereign Gloucester is a man Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit CARDINAL Did he not contrary to form of law Devise strange deaths for small offences done YORK And did he not in his protectorship Levy great sums of money through the realm For soldiers pay in France and never sent it By means whereof the towns each day revolted BUCKINGHAM Tut these are petty faults to faults unknown Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey KING HENRY My lords at once the care you have of us To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot Is worthy praise but shall I speak my conscience Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent From meaning treason to our royal person As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove The Duke is virtuous mild and too well given To dream on evil or to work my downfall QUEEN MARGARET Ah whats more dangerous than this fond affiance Seems he a dove His feathers are but borrowed For hes disposed as the hateful raven Is he a lamb His skin is surely lent him For hes inclined as is the ravenous wolves Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit Take heed my lord the welfare of us all Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man Enter Somerset SOMERSET All health unto my gracious sovereign KING HENRY Welcome Lord Somerset What news from France SOMERSET That all your interest in those territories Is utterly bereft you all is lost KING HENRY Cold news Lord Somerset but Gods will be done YORK Aside Cold news for me for I had hope of France As firmly as I hope for fertile England Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud And caterpillars eat my leaves away But I will remedy this gear ere long Or sell my title for a glorious grave Enter Gloucester GLOUCESTER All happiness unto my lord the King Pardon my liege that I have staid so long SUFFOLK Nay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art I do arrest thee of high treason here GLOUCESTER Well Suffolk thou shalt not see me blush Nor change my countenance for this arrest A heart unspotted is not easily daunted The purest spring is not so free from mud As I am clear from treason to my sovereign Who can accuse me Wherein am I guilty YORK Tis thought my lord that you took bribes of France And being Protector stayed the soldiers pay By means whereof his highness hath lost France GLOUCESTER Is it but thought so What are they that think it I never robbed the soldiers of their pay Nor ever had one penny bribe from France So help me God as I have watched the night Ay night by night in studying good for England That doit that eer I wrested from the King Or any groat I hoarded to my use Be brought against me at my trial day No many a pound of mine own proper store Because I would not tax the needy commons Have I dispursed to the garrisons And never asked for restitution CARDINAL It serves you well my lord to say so much GLOUCESTER I say no more than truth so help me God YORK In your protectorship you did devise Strange tortures for offenders never heard of That England was defamed by tyranny GLOUCESTER Why tis well known that whiles I was Protector Pity was all the fault that was in me For I should melt at an offenders tears And lowly words were ransom for their fault Unless it were a bloody murderer Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers I never gave them condign punishment Murder indeed that bloody sin I tortured Above the felon or what trespass else SUFFOLK My lord these faults are easy quickly answered But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself I do arrest you in his highness name And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal To keep until your further time of trial KING HENRY My Lord of Gloucester tis my special hope That you will clear yourself from all suspense My conscience tells me you are innocent GLOUCESTER Ah gracious lord these days are dangerous Virtue is choked with foul ambition And charity chased hence by rancours hand Foul subornation is predominant And equity exiled your highness land I know their complot is to have my life And if my death might make this island happy And prove the period of their tyranny I would expend it with all willingness But mine is made the prologue to their play For thousands more that yet suspect no peril Will not conclude their plotted tragedy Beauforts red sparkling eyes blab his hearts malice And Suffolks cloudy brow his stormy hate Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue The envious load that lies upon his heart And dogged York that reaches at the moon Whose overweening arm I have plucked back By false accuse doth level at my life And you my sovereign lady with the rest Cause"

BOLINGBROKE Duke of Hereford son of John of Gaunt afterwards King Henry IV DUKE OF AUMERLE son of the Duke of York THOMAS MOWBRAY Duke of Norfolk DUKE OF SURREY EARL OF SALISBURY LORD BERKELEY BUSHY Servant to King Richard BAGOT Servant to King Richard GREEN Servant to King Richard EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND HARRY PERCY surnamed Hotspur his son LORD ROSS LORD WILLOUGHBY LORD FITZWATER BISHOP OF CARLISLE ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER LORD MARSHAL SIR PIERCE OF EXTON SIR STEPHEN SCROOP Captain of a band of Welshmen QUEEN TO KING RICHARD DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER DUCHESS OF YORK Lady attending on the Queen Lords Heralds Officers Soldiers Gardeners Keeper Messenger Groom and other Attendants SCENE Dispersedly in England and Wales ACT I SCENE I London A Room in the palace Enter King Richard John of Gaunt with other Nobles and Attendants KING RICHARD Old John of Gaunt timehonoured Lancaster Hast thou according to thy oath and band Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son Here to make good the boistrous late appeal Which then our leisure would not let us hear Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray GAUNT I have my liege KING RICHARD Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice Or worthily as a good subject should On some known ground of treachery in him GAUNT As near as I could sift him on that argument On some apparent danger seen in him Aimed at your Highness no inveterate malice KING RICHARD Then call them to our presence Face to face And frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear The accuser and the accused freely speak Highstomached are they both and full of ire In rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire Enter Bolingbroke and Mowbray BOLINGBROKE Many years of happy days befall My gracious sovereign my most loving liege MOWBRAY Each day still better others happiness Until the heavens envying earths good hap Add an immortal title to your crown KING RICHARD We thank you both Yet one but flatters us As well appeareth by the cause you come Namely to appeal each other of high treason Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray BOLINGBROKE Firstheaven be the record to my speech In the devotion of a subjects love Tendring the precious safety of my prince And free from other misbegotten hate Come I appellant to this princely presence Now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee And mark my greeting well for what I speak My body shall make good upon this earth Or my divine soul answer it in heaven Thou art a traitor and a miscreant Too good to be so and too bad to live Since the more fair and crystal is the sky The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly Once more the more to aggravate the note With a foul traitors name stuff I thy throat And wish so please my sovereign ere I move What my tongue speaks my rightdrawn sword may prove MOWBRAY Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal Tis not the trial of a womans war The bitter clamour of two eager tongues Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain The blood is hot that must be cooled for this Yet can I not of such tame patience boast As to be hushed and naught at all to say First the fair reverence of your highness curbs me From giving reins and spurs to my free speech Which else would post until it had returned These terms of treason doubled down his throat Setting aside his high bloods royalty And let him be no kinsman to my liege I do defy him and I spit at him Call him a slanderous coward and a villain Which to maintain I would allow him odds And meet him were I tied to run afoot Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps Or any other ground inhabitable Wherever Englishman durst set his foot Meantime let this defend my loyalty By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie BOLINGBROKE Pale trembling coward there I throw my gage Disclaiming here the kindred of the King And lay aside my high bloods royalty Which fear not reverence makes thee to except If guilty dread have left thee so much strength As to take up mine honours pawn then stoop By that and all the rites of knighthood else Will I make good against thee arm to arm What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise MOWBRAY I take it up and by that sword I swear Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder Ill answer thee in any fair degree Or chivalrous design of knightly trial And when I mount alive may I not light If I be traitor or unjustly fight KING RICHARD What doth our cousin lay to Mowbrays charge It must be great that can inherit us So much as of a thought of ill in him BOLINGBROKE Look what I speak my life shall prove it true That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles In name of lendings for your highness soldiers The which he hath detained for lewd employments Like a false traitor and injurious villain Besides I say and will in battle prove Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge That ever was surveyed by English eye That all the treasons for these eighteen years Complotted and contrived in this land Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring Further I say and further will maintain Upon his bad life to make all this good That he did plot the Duke of Gloucesters death Suggest his soonbelieving adversaries And consequently like a traitor coward Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood Which blood like sacrificing Abels cries Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth To me for justice and rough chastisement And by the glorious worth of my descent This arm shall do it or this life be spent KING RICHARD How high a pitch his resolution soars Thomas of Norfolk what sayst thou to this MOWBRAY O let my sovereign turn away his face And bid his ears a little while be deaf Till I have told this slander of his blood How God and good men hate so foul a liar KING RICHARD Mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears Were he my brother nay my kingdoms heir As he is but my fathers brothers son Now by my sceptres awe I make a vow Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood Should nothing privilege him nor partialize The unstooping firmness of my upright soul He is our subject Mowbray so art thou Free speech and fearless I to thee allow MOWBRAY Then Bolingbroke as low as to thy heart Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais Disbursed I duly to his highness soldiers The other part reserved I by consent For that my sovereign liege was in my debt Upon remainder of a dear account Since last I went to France to fetch his queen Now swallow down that lie For Gloucesters death I slew him not but to my own disgrace Neglected my sworn duty in that case For you my noble Lord of Lancaster The honourable father to my foe Once did I lay an ambush for your life A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul But ere I last received the sacrament I did confess it and exactly begged Your Graces pardon and I hope I had it This is my fault As for the rest appealed It issues from the rancour of a villain A recreant and most degenerate traitor Which in myself I boldly will defend And interchangeably hurl down my gage Upon this overweening traitors foot To prove myself a loyal gentleman Even in the best blood chambered in his bosom In haste whereof most heartily I pray Your highness to assign our trial day KING RICHARD Wrathkindled gentlemen be ruled by me Lets purge this choler without letting blood This we prescribe though no physician Deep malice makes too deep incision Forget forgive conclude and be agreed Our doctors say this is no month to bleed Good uncle let this end where it begun Well calm the Duke of Norfolk you your son GAUNT To be a makepeace shall become my age Throw down my son the Duke of Norfolks gage KING RICHARD And Norfolk throw down his GAUNT When Harry when Obedience bids I should not bid again KING RICHARD Norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot MOWBRAY Myself I throw dread sovereign at thy foot My life thou shalt command but not my shame The one my duty owes but my fair name Despite of death that lives upon my grave To dark dishonours use thou shalt not have I am disgraced impeached and baffled here Pierced to the soul with slanders venomed spear The which"

There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory torture hell itself Hence banished is banishd from the world And worlds exile is death Then banished Is death mistermd Calling death banished Thou cuttst my head off with a golden axe And smilest upon the stroke that murders me FRIAR LAWRENCE O deadly sin O rude unthankfulness Thy fault our law calls death but the kind Prince Taking thy part hath brushd aside the law And turnd that black word death to banishment This is dear mercy and thou seest it not ROMEO Tis torture and not mercy Heaven is here Where Juliet lives and every cat and dog And little mouse every unworthy thing Live here in heaven and may look on her But Romeo may not More validity More honourable state more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo They may seize On the white wonder of dear Juliets hand And steal immortal blessing from her lips Who even in pure and vestal modesty Still blush as thinking their own kisses sin But Romeo may not he is banished This may flies do when I from this must fly They are free men but I am banished And sayst thou yet that exile is not death Hadst thou no poison mixd no sharpground knife No sudden mean of death though neer

thyself Why railst thou on thy birth the heaven and earth Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet In thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose Fie fie thou shamst thy shape thy love thy wit Which like a usurer aboundst in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit Thy noble shape is but a form of wax Digressing from the valour of a man Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury Killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish Thy wit that ornament to shape and love Misshapen in the conduct of them both Like powder in a skilless soldiers flask Is set afire by thine own ignorance And thou dismemberd with thine own defence What rouse thee man Thy Juliet is alive For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead There art thou happy Tybalt would kill thee But thou slewst Tybalt there art thou happy The law that threatend death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile there art thou happy A pack of blessings light upon thy back

Ascend her chamber hence and comfort her But look thou stay not till the watch be set For then thou canst not pass to Mantua Where thou shalt live till we can find a time To blaze your marriage
