maidens eyes stuck over all his face Love lackd a dwelling and made him her place And when in his fair parts she did abide She was new lodgd and newly deified His browny locks did hang in crooked curls And every light occasion of the wind Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls Whats sweet to do to do will aptly find Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind For on his visage was in little drawn What largeness thinks in paradise was sawn Small show of man was yet upon his chin His phoenix down began but to appear Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin Whose bare outbraggd the web it seemed to wear Yet showd his visage by that cost more dear And nice affections wavering stood in doubt If best were as it was or best without His qualities were beauteous as his form For maidentongued he was and thereof free Yet if men movd him was he such a storm As oft twixt May and April is to see When winds breathe sweet unruly though they be His rudeness so with his authorizd youth Did livery falseness in a pride of truth Well could he ride and often men would say That horse his mettle from his rider takes Proud of subjection noble by the sway What rounds what bounds what course what stop he makes And controversy hence a question takes Whether the horse by him became his deed Or he his manage by th welldoing steed But quickly on this side the verdict went His real habitude gave life and grace To appertainings and to ornament Accomplishd in himself not in his case All aids themselves made fairer by their place Came for additions yet their purposd trim Piecd not his grace but were all gracd by him So on the tip of his subduing tongue All kind of arguments and question deep All replication prompt and reason strong For his advantage still did wake and sleep To make the weeper laugh the laugher weep He had the dialect and different skill Catching all passions in his craft of will That he did in the general bosom reign Of young of old and sexes both enchanted To dwell with him in thoughts or to remain In personal duty following where he haunted Consents bewitchd ere he desire have granted And dialogued for him what he would say Askd their own wills and made their wills obey Many there were that did his picture get To serve their eyes and in it put their mind Like fools that in th imagination set The goodly objects which abroad they find Of lands and mansions theirs in thought assignd And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them So many have that never touchd his hand Sweetly supposd them mistress of his heart My woeful self that did in freedom stand And was my own feesimple not in part What with his art in youth and youth in art Threw my affections in his charmed power Reservd the stalk and gave him all my flower Yet did I not as some my equals did Demand of him nor being desired yielded Finding myself in honour so forbid With safest distance I mine honour shielded Experience for me many bulwarks builded Of proofs newbleeding which remaind the foil Of this false jewel and his amorous spoil But ah Who ever shunnd by precedent The destind ill she must herself assay Or forced examples gainst her own content To put the bypassd perils in her way Counsel may stop a while what will not stay For when we rage advice is often seen By blunting us to make our wills more keen Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood That we must curb it upon others proof To be forbode the sweets that seems so good For fear of harms that preach in our behoof O appetite from judgement stand aloof The one a palate hath that needs will taste Though reason weep and cry It is thy last For further I could say This mans untrue And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling Heard where his plants in others orchards grew Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling Thought characters and words merely but art And bastards of his foul adulterate heart And long upon these terms I held my city Till thus he gan besiege me Gentle maid Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity And be not of my holy vows afraid Thats to ye sworn to none was ever said For feasts of love I have been calld unto Till now did neer invite nor never woo All my offences that abroad you see Are errors of the blood none of the mind Love made them not with acture they may be Where neither party is nor true nor kind They sought their shame that so their shame did find And so much less of shame in me remains By how much of me their reproach contains Among the many that mine eyes have seen Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed Or my affection put to th smallest teen Or any of my leisures ever charmed Harm have I done to them but neer was harmed Kept hearts in liveries but mine own was free And reignd commanding in his monarchy Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me Of pallid pearls and rubies red as blood Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me Of grief and blushes aptly understood In bloodless white and the encrimsond mood Effects of terror and dear modesty Encampd in hearts but fighting outwardly And lo behold these talents of their hair With twisted metal amorously empleachd I have receivd from many a several fair Their kind acceptance weepingly beseechd With th annexions of fair gems enrichd And deepbraind sonnets that did amplify Each stones dear nature worth and quality The diamond why twas beautiful and hard Whereto his invisd properties did tend The deep green emerald in whose fresh regard Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend The heavenhued sapphire and the opal blend With objects manifold each several stone With wit well blazond smild or made some moan Lo all these trophies of affections hot Of pensivd and subdued desires the tender Nature hath chargd me that I hoard them not But yield them up where I myself must render That is to you my origin and ender For these of force must your oblations be Since I their altar you empatron me O then advance of yours that phraseless hand Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise Take all these similes to your own command Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise What me your minister for you obeys Works under you and to your audit comes Their distract parcels in combined sums Lo this device was sent me from a nun Or sister sanctified of holiest note Which late her noble suit in court did shun Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote For she was sought by spirits of richest coat But kept cold distance and did thence remove To spend her living in eternal love But O my sweet what labour ist to leave The thing we have not mastring what not strives Planing the place which did no form receive Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves She that her fame so to herself contrives The scars of battle scapeth by the flight And makes her absence valiant not her might O pardon me in that my boast is true The accident which brought me to her eye Upon the moment did her force subdue And now she would the caged cloister fly Religious love put out religions eye Not to be tempted would she be immurd And now to tempt all liberty procurd How mighty then you are O hear me tell The broken bosoms that to me belong Have emptied all their fountains in my well And mine I pour your ocean all among I strong oer them and you oer me being strong Must for your victory us all congest As compound love to physic your cold breast My parts had powr to charm a sacred nun Who disciplind and dieted in grace Believd her eyes when they tassail begun All vows and consecrations giving place O most potential love Vow bond nor space In thee hath neither sting knot nor confine For thou art all and all things else are thine When thou impressest what are precepts worth Of stale example When thou wilt inflame How coldly those impediments stand forth Of wealth of filial fear law kindred fame Loves arms are peace gainst rule gainst sense gainst shame And sweetens in the suffring pangs it bears The aloes of all forces shocks and fears Now all these hearts that do on mine depend Feeling it break with bleeding groans they pine And supplicant their sighs to your extend To leave the battry that you make gainst mine Lending soft audience to my sweet design And credent soul to that strongbonded oath That shall prefer and undertake my troth This said his watry eyes he did dismount Whose sights till then were levelld on my face Each cheek a river running from a fount With brinish current downward flowed apace O how the channel to the stream gave grace Who glazd with crystal gate the glowing roses That flame through water which their hue encloses O father what a hell of witchcraft lies In the small orb of one particular tear But with the inundation of the eyes What rocky heart to water will not wear What breast so cold that is not warmed here O cleft effect Cold modesty hot wrath Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath For lo his passion but an art of craft Even there resolvd my reason into tears There my white stole of chastity I daffd Shook off my sober guards and civil fears Appear to him as he to me appears All melting though our drops this diffrence bore His poisond me and mine did him restore In him a plenitude of subtle matter Applied to cautels all strange forms receives Of burning blushes or of weeping water Or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves In eithers aptness as it best deceives To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows That not a heart which in his level came Could scape the hail of his allhurting aim Showing fair nature is both kind and tame And veild in them did win whom he would maim Against the thing he sought he would exclaim When he most burned in heartwishd luxury He preachd pure maid and praisd cold chastity Thus merely with the garment of a grace The naked and concealed fiend he coverd That thunexperient gave the tempter place Which like a cherubin above them hoverd Who young and simple would not be so loverd Ay me I fell and yet do question make What I should do again for such a sake O that infected moisture of his eye O that false fire which in his cheek so glowd O that forcd thunder from his heart did fly O that sad breath his spongy lungs bestowd O all that borrowed motion seeming owed Would yet again betray the forebetrayed And new pervert a reconciled maid THE PASSIONATE PILGRIM I When my love swears that she is made of truth I do believe her though I know she lies That she might think me some untutord youth Unskilful in the worlds false forgeries Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young Although I know my years be past the best I smiling credit her falsespeaking tongue Outfacing faults in love with loves ill rest But wherefore says my love that she is young And wherefore say not I that I am old O loves best habit is a soothing tongue And age in love loves not to have years told Therefore Ill lie with love and love with me Since that our faults in love thus smotherd be II Two loves I have of comfort and despair That like two spirits do suggest me still My better angel is a man right fair My worser spirit a woman colourd ill To win me soon to hell my female evil Tempteth my better angel from my side And would corrupt my saint to be a devil Wooing his purity with her fair pride And whether that my angel be turnd fiend Suspect I may yet not directly tell For being both to me both to each friend I guess one angel in anothers hell The truth I shall not know but live in doubt Till my bad angel fire my good one out III Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye Gainst whom the world could not hold argument Persuade my heart to this false perjury Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment A woman I forswore but I will prove Thou being a goddess I forswore not thee My vow was earthly thou a heavenly love Thy grace being gaind cures all disgrace in me My vow was breath and breath a vapour is Then thou fair sun that on this earth doth shine Exhale this vapour vow in thee it is If broken then it is no fault of mine If by me broke what fool is not so wise To break an oath to win a paradise IV Sweet Cytherea sitting by a brook With young Adonis lovely fresh and green Did court the lad with many a lovely look Such looks as none could look but beautys queen She told him stories to delight his ear She showd him favours to allure his eye To win his heart she touchd him here and there Touches so soft still conquer chastity But whether unripe years did want conceit Or he refusd to take her figurd proffer The tender nibbler would not touch the bait But smile and jest at every gentle offer Then fell she on her back fair queen and toward He rose and ran away ah fool too froward V If love make me forsworn how shall I swear to love O never faith could hold if not to beauty vowed Though to myself forsworn to thee Ill constant prove Those thoughts to me like oaks to thee like osiers bowed Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend If knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire Thine eye Joves lightning seems thy voice his dreadful thunder Which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire Celestial as thou art O do not love that wrong To sing heavens praise with such an earthly"

marked you both and for you both did blush I heard your guilty rhymes observed your fashion Saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion Ay me says one O Jove the other cries One her hairs were gold crystal the others eyes To Longaville You would for paradise break faith and troth To Dumaine And Jove for your love would infringe an oath What will Berowne say when that he shall hear Faith infringed which such zeal did swear How will he scorn how will he spend his wit How will he triumph leap and laugh at it For all the wealth that ever I did see I would not have him know so much by me BEROWNE Comes forward Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy Ah good my liege I pray thee pardon me Good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove These worms for loving that art most in love Your eyes do make no coaches in your tears There is no certain princess that appears Youll not be perjured tis a hateful thing Tush none but minstrels like of sonneting But are you not ashamed Nay are you not All three of you to be thus much oershot You found his mote the King your mote did see But I a beam do find in each of three O what a scene of foolery have I seen Of sigh"

that mixed in his cheek Twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask There be some women Silvius had they marked him In parcels as I did would have gone near To fall in love with him but for my part I love him not nor hate him not and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him For what had he to do to chide at me He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And now I am remembered scorned at me I marvel why I answered not again But thats all one omittance is no quittance Ill write to him a very taunting letter And thou shalt bear it Wilt thou Silvius SILVIUS

Enter Rosalind Celia and Jaques JAQUES I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with thee ROSALIND They say you are a melancholy fellow JAQUES I am so I do love it better than laughing ROSALIND Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards JAQUES Why tis good to be sad and say nothing ROSALIND Why then tis good to be a post JAQUES I have neither the scholars melancholy which is emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical nor the courtiers which is proud nor the soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness ROSALIND A traveller By my faith you have great reason to be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands JAQUES Yes I have gained my experience ROSALIND And your experience makes you sad I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sadand to travel for it too Enter Orlando ORLANDO Good day and happiness dear Rosalind JAQUES Nay then God be wi you an you talk in blank verse ROSALIND Farewell Monsieur Traveller Look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola Exit Jaques Why how now Orlando where have you been all this while You a lover An you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more ORLANDO My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise ROSALIND Break an hours promise in love He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o the shoulder but Ill warrant him heartwhole ORLANDO Pardon me dear Rosalind ROSALIND Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I had as lief be wooed of a snail ORLANDO Of a snail ROSALIND Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his heada better jointure I think than you make a woman Besides he brings his destiny with him ORLANDO Whats that ROSALIND Why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife ORLANDO Virtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuous ROSALIND And I am your Rosalind CELIA It pleases him to call you so but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you ROSALIND Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent What would you say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind ORLANDO I would kiss before I spoke ROSALIND Nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lackingGod warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss ORLANDO How if the kiss be denied ROSALIND Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter ORLANDO Who could be out being before his beloved mistress ROSALIND Marry that should you if I were your mistress or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit ORLANDO What of my suit ROSALIND Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit Am not I your Rosalind ORLANDO I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her ROSALIND Well in her person I say I will not have you ORLANDO Then in mine own person I die ROSALIND No faith die by attorney The poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a lovecause Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love Leander he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos But these are all lies Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love ORLANDO I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind for I protest her frown might kill me ROSALIND By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now I will be your Rosalind in a more comingon disposition and ask me what you will I will grant it ORLANDO Then love me Rosalind ROSALIND Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all ORLANDO And wilt thou have me ROSALIND Ay and twenty such ORLANDO What sayest thou ROSALIND Are you not good ORLANDO I hope so ROSALIND Why then can one desire too much of a good thingCome sister you shall be the priest and marry usGive me your hand OrlandoWhat do you say sister ORLANDO Pray thee marry us CELIA I cannot say the words ROSALIND You must begin Will you Orlando CELIA Go toWill you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind ORLANDO I will ROSALIND Ay but when ORLANDO Why now as fast as she can marry us ROSALIND Then you must say I take thee Rosalind for wife ORLANDO I take thee Rosalind for wife ROSALIND I might ask you for your commission But I do take thee Orlando for my husband Theres a girl goes before the priest and certainly a womans thought runs before her actions ORLANDO So do all thoughts They are winged ROSALIND Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her ORLANDO For ever and a day ROSALIND Say a day without the ever No no Orlando men are April when they woo December when they wed Maids are May when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cockpigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey I will weep for nothing like Diana in the fountain and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry I will laugh like a hyena and that when thou are inclined to sleep ORLANDO But will my Rosalind do so ROSALIND By my life she will do as I do ORLANDO O but she is wise ROSALIND Or else she could not have the wit to do this The wiser the waywarder Make the doors upon a womans wit and it will out at the casement Shut that and twill out at the keyhole Stop that twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney ORLANDO A man that had a wife with such a wit he might say Wit whither wilt ROSALIND Nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed ORLANDO And what wit could wit have to excuse that ROSALIND Marry to say she came to seek you there You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue O that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool ORLANDO For these two hours Rosalind I will leave thee ROSALIND Alas dear love I cannot lack thee two hours ORLANDO I must attend the Duke at dinner By two oclock I will be with thee again ROSALIND Ay go your ways go your ways I knew what you would prove My friends told me as much and I thought no less That flattering tongue of yours won me Tis but one cast away and so come death Two oclock is your hour ORLANDO Ay sweet Rosalind ROSALIND By my troth and in good earnest and so God mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour I will think you the most pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful Therefore beware my censure and keep your promise ORLANDO With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind So adieu ROSALIND Well Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let time try Adieu Exit Orlando CELIA You have simply misused our sex in your loveprate We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest ROSALIND O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love But it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the Bay of Portugal CELIA Or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection in it runs out ROSALIND No that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses everyones eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep I am in love Ill tell thee Aliena I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando Ill go find a shadow and sigh till he come CELIA And Ill sleep Exeunt SCENE II Another part of the Forest Enter Jaques and Lords like foresters JAQUES Which is he that killed the deer FIRST LORD Sir it was I JAQUES Lets present him to the Duke like a Roman conqueror and it would do well to set the deers horns upon his head for a branch of victory Have you no song forester for this purpose SECOND LORD Yes sir JAQUES Sing it Tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enough SONG SECOND LORD Sings What shall he have that killed the deer His leather skin and horns to wear Then sing him home The rest shall bear this burden Take thou no scorn to wear the horn It was a crest ere thou wast born Thy fathers father wore it And thy father bore it The horn the horn the lusty horn Is not a thing to laugh to scorn Exeunt SCENE III Another part of the Forest Enter Rosalind and Celia ROSALIND How say you now Is it not past two oclock And here much Orlando CELIA I warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he hath taen his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep Enter Silvius Look who comes here SILVIUS My errand is to you fair youth My gentle Phoebe did bid me give you this Giving a letter I know not the contents but as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she did use as she was writing of it It bears an angry tenor Pardon me I am but as a guiltless messenger ROSALIND Patience herself would startle at this letter And play the swaggerer Bear this bear all She says I am not fair that I lack manners She calls me proud and that she could not love me Were man as rare as phoenix Ods my will Her love is not the hare that I do hunt Why writes she so to me Well shepherd well This is a letter of your own device SILVIUS No I protest I know not the contents Phoebe did write it ROSALIND Come come you are a fool And turned into the extremity of love I saw her hand She has a leathern hand A freestonecoloured hand I verily did think That her old gloves were on but twas her hands She has a huswifes handbut thats no matter I say she never did invent this letter This is a mans invention and his hand SILVIUS Sure it is hers ROSALIND Why tis a boisterous and a cruel style A style for challengers Why she defies me Like Turk to Christian Womens gentle brain Could not drop forth such giantrude invention Such Ethiop words blacker in their effect Than in their countenance Will you hear the letter SILVIUS So please you for I never heard it yet Yet heard too much of Phoebes cruelty ROSALIND She Phoebes me Mark how the tyrant writes Reads Art thou god to shepherd turned That a maidens heart hath burned Can a woman rail thus SILVIUS Call you this railing ROSALIND Why thy godhead laid apart Warrst thou with a womans heart Did you ever hear such railing Whiles the eye of man"

that she knew would flout her I measure him says she by my own spirit for I should flout him if he writ to me yea though I love him I should CLAUDIO Then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curses O sweet Benedick God give me patience LEONATO She doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself It is very true DON PEDRO It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it CLAUDIO To what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse DON PEDRO And he should it were an alms to hang him Shes an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous CLAUDIO And she is exceeding wise DON PEDRO In everything but in loving Benedick LEONATO O my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory I am sorry for her as I have just cause being her uncle and her guardian DON PEDRO I would she had bestowed this dotage on me I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say LEONATO Were it good think you CLAUDIO Hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness DON PEDRO She doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible hell scorn it for the manas you know allhath a contemptible spirit CLAUDIO He is a very proper man DON PEDRO He hath indeed a good outward happiness CLAUDIO Fore God and in my mind very wise DON PEDRO He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit CLAUDIO And I take him to be valiant DON PEDRO As Hector I assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most Christianlike fear LEONATO If he do fear God a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling DON PEDRO And so will he do for the man doth fear God howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make Well I am sorry for your niece Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love CLAUDIO Never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel LEONATO Nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first DON PEDRO Well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while I love Benedick well and I could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady LEONATO My lord will you walk dinner is ready CLAUDIO Aside If he do not dote on her upon this I will never trust my expectation DON PEDRO Aside Let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry The sport will be when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter thats the scene that I would see which will be merely a dumb show Let us send her to call him in to dinner Exeunt Don Pedro Claudio and Leonato BENEDICK Advancing from the arbour This can be no trick the conference was sadly borne They have the truth of this from Hero They seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent Love me why it must be requited I hear how I am censured they say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection I did never think to marry I must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending They say the lady is fair tis a truth I can bear them witness and virtuous tis so I cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for I will be horribly in love with her I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour No the world must be peopled When I said I would die a bachelor I did not think I should live till I were married Here comes Beatrice By this day shes a fair lady I do spy some marks of love in her Enter Beatrice BEATRICE Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner BENEDICK Fair Beatrice I thank you for your pains BEATRICE I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful I would not have come BENEDICK You take pleasure then in the message BEATRICE Yea just so much as you may take upon a knifes point and choke a daw withal You have no stomach signior fare you well Exit BENEDICK Ha Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner theres a double meaning in that I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me thats as much as to say Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks If I do not take pity of her I am a villain if I do not love her I am a Jew I will go get her picture Exit ACT III SCENE I Leonatos Garden Enter Hero Margaret and Ursula HERO Good Margaret run thee to the parlour There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursala Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse Is all of her say that thou overheardst us And bid her steal into the pleached bower Where honeysuckles ripend by the sun Forbid the sun to enter like favourites Made proud by princes that advance their pride Against that power that bred it There will she hide her To listen our propose This is thy office Bear thee well in it and leave us alone MARGARET Ill make her come I warrant you presently Exit HERO Now Ursula when Beatrice doth come As we do trace this alley up and down Our talk must only be of Benedick When I do name him let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice of this matter Is little Cupids crafty arrow made That only wounds by hearsay Enter Beatrice behind Now begin For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs Close by the ground to hear our conference URSULA The pleasantst angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream And greedily devour the treacherous bait So angle we for Beatrice who even now Is couched in the woodbine coverture Fear you not my part of the dialogue HERO Then go we near her that her ear lose nothing Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it They advance to the bower No truly Ursula she is too disdainful I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggards of the rock URSULA But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely HERO So says the Prince and my newtrothed lord URSULA And did they bid you tell her of it madam HERO They did entreat me to acquaint her of it But I persuaded them if they lovd Benedick To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it URSULA Why did you so Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon HERO O god of love I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man But Nature never framd a womans heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes Misprising what they look on and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak She cannot love Nor take no shape nor project of affection She is so selfendeard URSULA Sure I think so And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love lest she make sport at it HERO Why you speak truth I never yet saw man How wise how noble young how rarely featurd But she would spell him backward if fairfacd She would swear the gentleman should be her sister If black why Nature drawing of an antick Made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded If low an agate very vilely cut If speaking why a vane blown with all winds If silent why a block moved with none So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth URSULA Sure sure such carping is not commendable HERO No not to be so odd and from all fashions As Beatrice is cannot be commendable But who dare tell her so If I should speak She would mock me into air O she would laugh me Out of myself press me to death with wit Therefore let Benedick like coverd fire Consume away in sighs waste inwardly It were a better death than die with mocks Which is as bad as die with tickling URSULA Yet tell her of it hear what she will say HERO No rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion And truly Ill devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking URSULA O do not do your cousin such a wrong She cannot be so much without true judgment Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prizd to haveas to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick HERO He is the only man of Italy Always excepted my dear Claudio URSULA I pray you be not angry with me madam Speaking my fancy Signior Benedick For shape for bearing argument and valour Goes foremost in report through Italy HERO Indeed he hath an excellent good name URSULA His excellence did earn it ere he had it When are you married madam HERO Why every day tomorrow Come go in Ill show thee some attires and have thy counsel Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow URSULA Shes limd I warrant you We have caught her madam HERO If it prove so then loving goes by haps Some Cupid kills with arrows some with traps Exeunt Hero and Ursula BEATRICE Advancing What fire is in mine ears Can this be true Stand I condemnd for pride and scorn so much Contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu No glory lives behind the back of such And Benedick love on I will requite thee Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand If thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee To bind our loves up in a holy band For others say thou dost deserve and I Believe it better than reportingly Exit SCENE II A Room in Leonatos House Enter Don Pedro Claudio Benedick and Leonato DON PEDRO I do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go I toward Arragon CLAUDIO Ill bring you thither my lord if youll vouchsafe me DON PEDRO Nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it I will only be bold with Benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut Cupids bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him He hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks BENEDICK Gallants I am not as I have been LEONATO So say I methinks you are sadder CLAUDIO I hope he be in love DON PEDRO Hang him truant theres no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love If he be sad he wants money BENEDICK I have the toothache DON PEDRO Draw it BENEDICK Hang it CLAUDIO You must hang it first and draw it afterwards DON PEDRO What sigh for the toothache LEONATO Where is but a humour or a worm BENEDICK Well everyone can master a grief but he that has it CLAUDIO Yet say I he is in love DON PEDRO There is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a Dutchman today a Frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a German from the waist downward all slops and a Spaniard from the hip upward no doublet Unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is CLAUDIO If he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a brushes his hat a mornings what should that bode DON PEDRO Hath any man seen him at the barbers CLAUDIO No but the barbers man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls LEONATO Indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard DON PEDRO Nay a rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that CLAUDIO Thats as much as to say the sweet youths in love DON PEDRO The greatest note of it is his melancholy CLAUDIO And when was he wont to wash his face DON PEDRO Yea or to paint himself for the which I hear what they say of him CLAUDIO Nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lutestring and now governed by stops DON PEDRO Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him Conclude conclude he is in love CLAUDIO Nay but I know who loves him DON PEDRO That would I know too I warrant one that knows him not CLAUDIO Yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for him DON PEDRO She shall be buried with her face upwards BENEDICK Yet is this no charm for the tooth"

mine and thine GLOUCESTER Be patient gentle Nell forget this grief ELEANOR Ah Gloucester teach me to forget myself For whilst I think I am thy married wife And thou a prince Protector of this land Methinks I should not thus be led along Mailed up in shame with papers on my back And followed with a rabble that rejoice To see my tears and hear my deepfet groans The ruthless flint doth cut my

a sennet Enter the King the Queen Cardinal Beaufort Suffolk York Buckingham Salisbury and Warwick to the Parliament KING HENRY I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man Whateer occasion keeps him from us now QUEEN MARGARET Can you not see or will ye not observe The strangeness of his altered countenance With what a majesty he bears himself How insolent of late he is become How proud how peremptory and unlike himself We know the time since he was mild and affable And if we did but glance a faroff look Immediately he was upon his knee That all the court admired him for submission But meet him now and be it in the morn When everyone will give the time of day He knits his brow and shows an angry eye And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee Disdaining duty that to us belongs Small curs are not regarded when they grin But great men tremble when the lion roars And Humphrey is no little man in England First note that he is near you in descent And should you fall he is the next will mount Me seemeth then it is no policy Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears And his advantage following your decease That he should come about your royal person Or be admitted to your Highness Council By flattery hath he won the commons hearts And when he please to make commotion Tis to be feared they all will follow him Now tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted Suffer them now and theyll oergrow the garden And choke the herbs for want of husbandry The reverent care I bear unto my lord Made me collect these dangers in the Duke If it be fond can it a womans fear Which fear if better reasons can supplant I will subscribe and say I wronged the Duke My Lord of Suffolk Buckingham and York Reprove my allegation if you can Or else conclude my words effectual SUFFOLK Well hath your highness seen into this Duke And had I first been put to speak my mind I think I should have told your graces tale The Duchess by his subornation Upon my life began her devilish practices Or if he were not privy to those faults Yet by reputing of his high descent As next the King he was successive heir And such high vaunts of his nobility Did instigate the bedlam brainsick Duchess By wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep And in his simple show he harbours treason The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb No no my sovereign Gloucester is a man Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit CARDINAL Did he not contrary to form of law Devise strange deaths for small offences done YORK And did he not in his protectorship Levy great sums of money through the realm For soldiers pay in France and never sent it By means whereof the towns each day revolted BUCKINGHAM Tut these are petty faults to faults unknown Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey KING HENRY My lords at once the care you have of us To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot Is worthy praise but shall I speak my conscience Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent From meaning treason to our royal person As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove The Duke is virtuous mild and too well given To dream on evil or to work my downfall QUEEN MARGARET Ah whats more dangerous than this fond affiance Seems he a dove His feathers are but borrowed For hes disposed as the hateful raven Is he a lamb His skin is surely lent him For hes inclined as is the ravenous wolves Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit Take heed my lord the welfare of us all Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man Enter Somerset SOMERSET All health unto my gracious sovereign KING HENRY Welcome Lord Somerset What news from France SOMERSET That all your interest in those territories Is utterly bereft you all is lost KING HENRY Cold news Lord Somerset but Gods will be done YORK Aside Cold news for me for I had hope of France As firmly as I hope for fertile England Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud And caterpillars eat my leaves away But I will remedy this gear ere long Or sell my title for a glorious grave Enter Gloucester GLOUCESTER All happiness unto my lord the King Pardon my liege that I have staid so long SUFFOLK Nay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art I do arrest thee of high treason here GLOUCESTER Well Suffolk thou shalt not see me blush Nor change my countenance for this arrest A heart unspotted is not easily daunted The purest spring is not so free from mud As I am clear from treason to my sovereign Who can accuse me Wherein am I guilty YORK Tis thought my lord that you took bribes of France And being Protector stayed the soldiers pay By means whereof his highness hath lost France GLOUCESTER Is it but thought so What are they that think it I never robbed the soldiers of their pay Nor ever had one penny bribe from France So help me God as I have watched the night Ay night by night in studying good for England That doit that eer I wrested from the King Or any groat I hoarded to my use Be brought against me at my trial day No many a pound of mine own proper store Because I would not tax the needy commons Have I dispursed to the garrisons And never asked for restitution CARDINAL It serves you well my lord to say so much GLOUCESTER I say no more than truth so help me God YORK In your protectorship you did devise Strange tortures for offenders never heard of That England was defamed by tyranny GLOUCESTER"

hither Henry Hereford thy bold son Here to make good the boistrous late appeal Which then our leisure would not let us hear Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray GAUNT I have my liege KING RICHARD Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice Or worthily as a good subject should On some known ground of treachery in him GAUNT As near as I could sift him on that argument On some apparent danger seen in him Aimed at your Highness no inveterate malice KING RICHARD Then call them to our presence Face to face And frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear The accuser and the accused freely speak Highstomached are they both and full of ire In rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire Enter Bolingbroke and Mowbray BOLINGBROKE Many years of happy days befall My gracious sovereign my most loving liege MOWBRAY Each day still better others happiness Until the heavens envying earths good hap Add an immortal title to your crown KING RICHARD We thank you both Yet one but flatters us As well appeareth by the cause you come Namely to appeal each other of high treason Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray BOLINGBROKE

Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee And mark my greeting well for what I speak My body shall make good upon this earth Or my divine soul answer it in heaven Thou art a traitor and a miscreant Too good to

reverence of your highness curbs me From giving reins and spurs to my free speech Which else would post until it had returned These terms of treason doubled down his throat Setting aside his high bloods royalty And let him be no kinsman to my liege I do defy him and I spit at him Call him a slanderous coward and a villain Which to maintain I would allow him odds And meet him were I tied to run afoot Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps Or any other ground inhabitable Wherever Englishman durst set his foot Meantime let this defend my loyalty By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie BOLINGBROKE Pale trembling coward there I throw my gage Disclaiming here the kindred of the King And lay aside my high bloods royalty Which fear not reverence makes thee to except If guilty dread have left thee so much strength As to take up mine honours pawn then stoop By that and all the rites of knighthood else Will I make good against thee arm to arm What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise

speak my life shall prove it true That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles In name of lendings for your highness soldiers The which he hath detained for lewd employments Like a false traitor and injurious villain Besides I say and will in battle prove Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge That ever was surveyed by English eye That all the treasons for these eighteen years Complotted and contrived in this land Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring Further I say and further will maintain Upon his bad life to make all this good That he did plot the Duke of Gloucesters death Suggest his soonbelieving adversaries And consequently like a traitor coward Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood Which blood like sacrificing Abels cries Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth To me for justice and rough chastisement And by the glorious worth of my descent This arm shall do it or this life be spent KING RICHARD How high a pitch his resolution soars Thomas of Norfolk what sayst thou to this MOWBRAY O let my sovereign turn away his face And bid his ears a little while be deaf Till I have told this slander of his blood How God and good men

These tidings nip me and I hang the head As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms Ay now begins our sorrows to approach Tis he the common people love so much Myself hath often overheard them say When I have walked like a private man That Lucius banishment was wrongfully And they have wished that Lucius were their emperor TAMORA Why should you fear Is not your city strong SATURNINUS Ay but the citizens favour Lucius And will revolt from me to succour him TAMORA King be thy thoughts imperious like thy name Is the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in it The eagle suffers little birds to sing And is not careful what they mean thereby Knowing that with the shadow of his wings He can at pleasure stint their melody Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome Then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor I will enchant the old Andronicus With words more sweet and yet more dangerous Than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep Whenas the one is wounded with the bait The other rotted with delicious feed SATURNINUS But he will not entreat his son for us TAMORA If Tamora entreat him then he will For I can smooth and fill his aged ears With golden promises that were his heart Almost impregnable his old ears deaf Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue to Aemilius Go thou before be our ambassador Say that the emperor requests a parley Of warlike Lucius and appoint the meeting Even at his fathers house the old Andronicus SATURNINUS Aemilius do this message honourably And if he stand on hostage for his safety Bid him demand what pledge will please him best AEMILIUS Your bidding shall I do effectually Exit TAMORA Now will I to that old Andronicus And temper him with all the art I have To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths And now sweet emperor be blithe again And bury all thy fear in my devices SATURNINUS Then go successantly and plead to him Exeunt ACT V SCENE I Plains near Rome Enter Lucius with an army of Goths with drums and soldiers LUCIUS Approved warriors and my faithful friends I have received letters from great Rome Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor And how desirous of our sight they are Therefore great lords be as your titles witness Imperious and impatient of your wrongs And wherein Rome hath done you any scath Let him make treble satisfaction FIRST GOTH Brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus Whose name was once our terror now our comfort Whose high exploits and honourable deeds Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt Be bold in us Well follow where thou leadst Like stinging bees in hottest summers day Led by their master to the flowered fields And be avenged on cursed Tamora GOTHS And as he saith so say we all with him LUCIUS I humbly thank him and I thank you all But who comes here led by a lusty Goth Enter a Goth leading of Aaron with his Child in his arms SECOND GOTH Renowned Lucius from our troops I strayed To gaze upon a ruinous monastery And as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall I made unto the noise when soon I heard The crying babe controlled with this discourse Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dame Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art Had nature lent thee but thy mothers look Villain thou mightst have been an emperor But where the bull and cow are both milkwhite They never do beget a coalblack calf Peace villain peace even thus he rates the babe For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth Who when he knows thou art the empress babe Will hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake With this my weapon drawn I rushed upon him Surprised him suddenly and brought him hither To use as you think needful of the man LUCIUS O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil That robbed Andronicus of his good hand This is the pearl that pleased your empress eye And heres the base fruit of her burning lust Say walleyed slave whither wouldst thou convey This growing image of thy fiendlike face Why dost not speak What deaf Not a word A halter soldiers hang him on this tree And by his side his fruit of bastardy AARON Touch not the boy he is of royal blood LUCIUS Too like the sire for ever being good First hang the child that he may see it sprawl A sight to vex the fathers soul withal Get me a ladder A ladder is brought which Aaron is made to ascend AARON Lucius save the child And bear it from me to the empress If thou do this Ill show thee wondrous things That highly may advantage thee to hear If thou wilt not befall what may befall Ill speak no more but Vengeance rot you all LUCIUS Say on and if it please me which thou speakst Thy child shall live and I will see it nourished AARON And if it please thee Why assure thee Lucius Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres Acts of black night abominable deeds Complots of mischief treason villainies Ruthful to hear yet piteously performed And this shall all be buried in my death Unless thou swear to me my child shall live LUCIUS Tell on thy mind I say thy child shall live AARON Swear that he shall and then I will begin LUCIUS Who should I swear by Thou believst no god That granted how canst thou believe an oath AARON What if I do not As indeed I do not Yet for I know thou art religious And hast a thing within thee called conscience With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies Which I have seen thee careful to observe Therefore I urge thy oath for that I know An idiot holds his bauble for a god And keeps the oath which by that god he swears To that Ill urge him Therefore thou shalt vow By that same god what god soeer it be That thou adorest and hast in reverence To save my boy to nourish and bring him up Or else I will discover naught to thee LUCIUS Even by my god I swear to thee I will AARON First know thou I begot him on the empress LUCIUS O most insatiate and luxurious woman AARON Tut Lucius this was but a deed of charity To that which thou shalt hear of me anon Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus They cut thy sisters tongue and ravished her And cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest LUCIUS O detestable villain callst thou that trimming AARON Why she was washed and cut and trimmed and twas Trim sport for them which had the doing of it LUCIUS O barbarous beastly villains like thyself AARON Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them That codding spirit had they from their mother As sure a card as ever won the set That bloody mind I think they learned of me As true a dog as ever fought at head Well let my deeds be witness of my worth I trained thy brethren to that guileful hole Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay I wrote the letter that thy father found And hid the gold within that letter mentioned Confederate with the queen and her two sons And what not done that thou hast cause to rue Wherein I had no stroke of mischief int I played the cheater for thy fathers hand And when I had it drew myself apart And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter I pried me through the crevice of a wall When for his hand he had his two sons heads Beheld his tears and laughed so heartily That both mine eyes were rainy like to his And when I

exits above TAMORA This closing with him fits his lunacy Whateer I forge to feed his brainsick humours Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches For now he firmly takes me for Revenge And being

of a calm world and a long peace ten times more dishonourableragged than an old fazed ancient and such have I to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from swinekeeping from eating draff and husks A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies No eye hath seen such scarecrows Ill not march through Coventry with them thats flat Nay and the villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on for indeed I had the most of them

beweep to many simple gulls Namely to Derby Hastings Buckingham And tell them tis the Queen and her allies That stir the King against the Duke my brother Now they believe it and withal whet me To be revenged on Rivers Dorset Grey But then I sigh and with a piece of Scripture Tell them that God bids us do good for evil And thus I clothe my naked villany With odd old ends stoln forth of Holy Writ And seem a saint when most I play the devil Enter two Murderers But soft here come my executioners How now my hardy stout resolved mates Are you now going to dispatch this thing FIRST MURDERER We are my lord and come to have the warrant That we may be admitted where he is RICHARD Well thought upon I have it here about me Gives the warrant When you have done repair to Crosby Place But sirs be

night So full of fearful dreams of ugly sights That as I am a Christian faithful man I would not spend another such a night Though twere to buy a world of happy days So full of dismal terror was the time KEEPER What was your dream my lord I pray you tell me CLARENCE Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embarked to cross to Burgundy And in my company my brother Gloucester Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches Thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand heavy times During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befalln us As we paced along Upon the giddy footing of the hatches Methought that Gloucester stumbled and in falling Struck me that thought to stay him overboard Into the tumbling billows of the main O Lord methought what pain it was to drown What dreadful noise of waters in my ears What sights of ugly death within my eyes Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl Inestimable stones unvalued jewels All scattered in the bottom of the sea Some lay in dead mens skulls and in the holes Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept As twere in scorn of eyesreflecting gems That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by KEEPER Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon these secrets of the deep CLARENCE Methought I had and often did I strive To yield the ghost but still the envious flood Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth To find the empty vast and wandring air But smothered it within my panting bulk Who almost burst to belch it in the sea KEEPER Awaked you not in this sore agony CLARENCE No no my dream was lengthened after life O then began the tempest to my soul I passed methought the melancholy flood With that sour ferryman which poets write of Unto the kingdom of perpetual night The first that there did greet my strangersoul Was my great fatherinlaw renowned Warwick Who spake aloud What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence And so he vanished Then came wandring by A shadow like an angel with bright hair Dabbled in blood and he shrieked out aloud Clarence is comefalse fleeting perjured Clarence That stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury Seize on him Furies Take him unto torment With that methoughts a legion of foul fiends Environed me and howled in mine ears Such hideous cries that with the very noise I trembling waked and for a season after Could not believe but that I was in hell Such terrible impression made my dream KEEPER No marvel lord though it affrighted you I am afraid methinks to hear you tell it CLARENCE Ah Keeper Keeper I have done these things That now give evidence against my soul For Edwards sake and see how he requites me O God if my deep prayers cannot appease Thee But Thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children Keeper I prithee sit by me awhile My soul is heavy and I fain would sleep KEEPER I will my lord God give your Grace good rest Clarence reposes himself on a chair Enter Brakenbury the Lieutenant BRAKENBURY Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours Makes the night morning and the noontide night Princes have but their titles for their glories An outward honour for an inward toil And for unfelt imaginations They often feel a world of restless cares So that between their titles and low name Theres nothing differs but the outward fame Enter the two Murderers FIRST MURDERER Ho whos here BRAKENBURY What wouldst thou fellow And how camst thou hither SECOND MURDERER I would speak with Clarence and I came hither on my legs BRAKENBURY What so brief FIRST MURDERER Tis better sir than to be tedious Let him see our commission and talk no more Brakenbury reads the commission BRAKENBURY I am in this commanded to deliver The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands I will not reason what is meant hereby Because I will be guiltless of the meaning There lies the Duke asleep and there the keys Ill to the King and signify to him That thus I have resigned to you my charge FIRST MURDERER You may sir tis a point of wisdom Fare you well Exeunt Brakenbury and the Keeper SECOND MURDERER What shall I stab him as he sleeps FIRST MURDERER No Hell say twas done cowardly when he wakes SECOND MURDERER Why he shall never wake until the great Judgement Day FIRST MURDERER Why then hell say we stabbed him sleeping SECOND MURDERER The urging of that word judgement hath bred a kind of remorse in me FIRST MURDERER What art thou afraid SECOND MURDERER Not to kill him having a warrant but to be damned for killing him from the which no warrant can defend me FIRST MURDERER I thought thou hadst been resolute SECOND MURDERER So I amto let him live FIRST MURDERER Ill back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him so SECOND MURDERER Nay I prithee stay a little I hope this passionate humour will change It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty FIRST MURDERER How dost thou feel thyself now SECOND MURDERER Faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me FIRST MURDERER Remember our reward when the deeds done SECOND MURDERER Zounds he dies I had forgot the reward FIRST MURDERER Wheres thy conscience now SECOND MURDERER O in the Duke of Gloucesters purse FIRST MURDERER So when he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out SECOND MURDERER Tis no matter let it go Theres few or none will entertain it FIRST MURDERER What if it come to thee again SECOND MURDERER Ill not meddle with it it makes a man coward A man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his neighbours wife but it detects him Tis a blushing shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a mans bosom It fills a man full of obstacles It made me once restore a purse of gold that by chance I found It beggars any man that keeps it It is turned out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and live without it FIRST MURDERER Zounds tis even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the Duke SECOND MURDERER Take the devil in thy mind and believe him not He would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh FIRST MURDERER I am strongframed he cannot prevail with me SECOND MURDERER Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation Come shall we fall to work FIRST MURDERER Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then throw him in the malmseybutt in the next room SECOND MURDERER O excellent deviceand make a sop of him FIRST MURDERER Soft he wakes SECOND MURDERER Strike FIRST MURDERER No well reason with him CLARENCE Where art thou keeper Give me a cup of wine SECOND MURDERER You shall have wine enough my lord anon CLARENCE In Gods name what art thou FIRST MURDERER A man as you are CLARENCE But not as I am royal SECOND MURDERER Nor you as we are loyal CLARENCE Thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble FIRST MURDERER My voice is now the Kings my looks mine own CLARENCE How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak Your eyes do menace me why look you pale Who sent you hither Wherefore do you come SECOND MURDERER To to to CLARENCE To murder me BOTH MURDERERS Ay ay CLARENCE You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it Wherein my friends have I offended you FIRST MURDERER Offended us you have not but the King CLARENCE I shall be reconciled to him again SECOND MURDERER Never my lord therefore prepare to die CLARENCE Are you drawn forth among a world of men To slay the innocent What is my offence Where is the evidence that doth accuse me What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge Or who pronounced The bitter sentence of poor Clarence death Before I be convict by course of law To threaten me with death is most unlawful I charge you as you hope to have redemption By Christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins That you depart and lay no hands on me The deed you undertake is damnable FIRST MURDERER What we will do we do upon command SECOND MURDERER And he that hath commanded is our King CLARENCE Erroneous vassals The great King of kings Hath in the table of his law commanded That thou shalt do no murder Will you then Spurn at His edict and fulfil a mans Take heed for He holds vengeance in His hand To hurl upon their heads that break His law SECOND MURDERER And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee For false forswearing and for murder too Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight In quarrel of the house of Lancaster FIRST MURDERER And like a traitor to the name of God Didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade Unrippedst the bowels of thy sovereigns son SECOND MURDERER Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend FIRST MURDERER How canst thou urge Gods dreadful law to us When thou hast broke it in such dear degree CLARENCE Alas for whose sake did I that ill deed For Edward for my brother for his sake He sends you not to murder me for this For in that sin he is as deep as I If God will be avenged for the deed O know you yet He doth it publicly Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm He needs no indirect or lawless course To cut off those that have offended Him FIRST MURDERER Who made thee then a bloody minister When gallantspringing brave Plantagenet That princely novice was struck dead by thee CLARENCE My brothers love the devil and my rage FIRST MURDERER Thy brothers love our duty and thy faults Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee CLARENCE If you do love my brother hate not me I am his brother and I love him well If you are hired"

It is a bitter deputy DUKE Not so not so His life is paralleled Even with the stroke and line of his great justice He doth with holy abstinence subdue That in himself which he spurs on his power To qualify in others Were he mealed with that Which he corrects then were he tyrannous But this being so hes just Knocking within Provost goes to the door Now are they come This is a gentle provost

it is You shall hear more ere morning PROVOST Happily You something know yet I believe there comes No countermand No such example have we Besides upon the very siege of justice Lord Angelo hath to the public ear Professed the contrary Enter a Messenger This is his Lordships man DUKE And here comes Claudios pardon MESSENGER My lord hath sent you this note and by me this further charge that you swerve not from the smallest article of it neither in time matter or other circumstance Good morrow for as I take it it is almost day PROVOST I shall obey him Exit Messenger DUKE Aside This is his pardon purchased by such sin For which the pardoner himself is in Hence hath offence his quick celerity When it is borne in high authority When vice makes mercy mercys so extended That for the faults love is th offender friended Now sir what news PROVOST I told you Lord Angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted puttingon methinks strangely for he hath not used it before DUKE Pray you lets hear PROVOST Reads Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let Claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon Barnardine For my better satisfaction let me have Claudios head sent me by five Let this be duly performed with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver Thus fail not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril What say you to this sir DUKE What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th afternoon PROVOST A Bohemian born but here nursed up and bred one that is a prisoner nine years old DUKE How came it that the absent Duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him I have heard it was ever his manner to do so PROVOST His friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed his fact till now in the government of Lord Angelo came not to an undoubtful proof DUKE It is now apparent PROVOST Most manifest and not denied by himself DUKE Hath he borne himself penitently in prison How seems he to be touched PROVOST A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of whats past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal DUKE He wants advice PROVOST He will hear none He hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not Drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk We have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it It hath not moved him at all DUKE More of him anon There is written in your brow Provost honesty and constancy if I read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me But in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard Claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenced him To make you understand this in a manifested effect I crave but four days respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy PROVOST Pray sir in what DUKE In the delaying death PROVOST Alack how may I do it Having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of Angelo I may make my case as Claudios to cross this in the smallest DUKE By the vow of mine order I warrant you if my instructions may be your guide Let this Barnardine be this morning executed and his head borne to Angelo PROVOST Angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour DUKE O deaths a great disguiser and you may add to it Shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death You know the course is common If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom I profess I will plead against it with my life PROVOST Pardon me good father it is against my oath DUKE Were you sworn to the Duke or to the Deputy PROVOST To him and to his substitutes DUKE You will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch the justice of your dealing PROVOST But what likelihood is in that DUKE Not a resemblance but a certainty Yet since I see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you I will go further than I meant to pluck all fears out of you Look you sir here is the hand and seal of the Duke You know the character I doubt not and the signet is not strange to you PROVOST I know them both DUKE The contents of this is the return of the Duke you shall anon overread it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here This is a thing that Angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour perchance of the Dukes death perchance entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ Look th unfolding star calls up the shepherd Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be All difficulties are but easy when they are known Call your executioner and off with Barnardines head I will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place Yet you are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you Come away it is almost clear dawn Exeunt SCENE III Another room in the same Enter Pompey

was no semblance did remain Her blue blood changed to black in every vein Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed Showed life imprisoned in a body dead On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes And shapes her sorrow to the beldams woes Who nothing wants to answer her but cries And bitter words to ban her cruel foes The painter was no god to lend her those And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong To give her so much grief and not a tongue Poor instrument quoth she without a sound Ill tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue And drop sweet balm in Priams painted wound And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies Show me the strumpet that began this stir That with my nails her beauty I may tear Thy heat of lust fond Paris did incur This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here And here in Troy for trespass of thine eye The sire the son the dame and daughter die Why should the private pleasure of some one Become the public plague of many moe Let sin alone committed light alone Upon his head that hath transgressed so Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe For ones offence why should so many fall To plague a private sin in general Lo here weeps Hecuba here Priam dies Here manly Hector faints here Troilus swounds Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds And one mans lust these many lives confounds Had doting Priam checked his sons desire Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire Here feelingly she weeps Troys painted woes For sorrow like a heavyhanging bell Once set on ringing with his own weight goes Then little strength rings out the doleful knell So Lucrece set awork sad tales doth tell To pencilled pensiveness and coloured sorrow She lends them words and she their looks doth borrow She throws her eyes about the painting round And who she finds forlorn she doth lament At last she sees a wretched image bound That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent His face though full of cares yet showed content Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes So mild that patience seemed to scorn his woes In him the painter laboured with his skill To hide deceit and give the harmless show An humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still A brow unbent that seemed to welcome woe Cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so That blushing red no guilty instance gave Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have But like a constant and confirmed devil He entertained a show so seeming just And therein so ensconced his secret evil That jealousy itself could not mistrust Falsecreeping craft and perjury should thrust Into so bright a day such blackfaced storms Or blot with hellborn sin such saintlike forms The wellskilled workman this mild image drew For perjured Sinon whose enchanting story The credulous Old Priam after slew Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory Of richbuilt Ilion that the skies were sorry And little stars shot from their fixed places When their glass fell wherein they viewed their faces This picture she advisedly perused And chid the painter for his wondrous skill Saying some shape in Sinons was abused So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill And still on him she gazed and gazing still Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied That she concludes the picture was belied It cannot be quoth she that so much guile She would have said can lurk in such a look But Tarquins shape came in her mind the while And from her tongue can lurk from cannot took It cannot be she in that sense forsook And turned it thus It cannot be I find But such a face should bear a wicked mind For even as subtle Sinon here is painted So sobersad so weary and so mild As if with grief or travail he had fainted To me came Tarquin armed too beguiled With outward honesty but yet defiled With inward vice As Priam him did cherish So did I Tarquin so my Troy did perish Look look how listening Priam wets his eyes To see those borrowed tears that Sinon sheds Priam why art thou old and yet not wise For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds His eye drops fire no water thence proceeds Those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city Such devils steal effects from lightless hell For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold And in that cold hotburning fire doth dwell These contraries such unity do hold Only to flatter fools and make them bold So Priams trust false Sinons tears doth flatter That he finds means to burn his Troy with water Here all enraged such passion her assails That patience is quite beaten from her breast She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails Comparing him to that unhappy guest Whose deed hath made herself herself detest At last she smilingly with this gives oer Fool fool quoth she his wounds will not be sore Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow And time doth weary time with her complaining She looks for night and then she longs for morrow And both she thinks too long with her remaining Short time seems long in sorrows sharp sustaining Though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps And they that watch see time how slow it creeps Which all this time hath overslipped her thought That she with painted images hath spent Being from the feeling of her own grief brought By deep surmise of others detriment Losing her woes in shows of discontent It easeth some though none it ever cured To think their dolour others have endured But now the mindful messenger come back Brings home his lord and other company Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black And round about her teardistained eye Blue circles streamed like rainbows in the sky These watergalls in her dim element Foretell new storms to those already spent Which when her sadbeholding husband saw Amazedly in her sad face he stares Her eyes though sod in tears looked red and raw Her lively colour killed with deadly cares He hath no power to ask her how she fares Both stood like old acquaintance in a trance Met far from home wondring each others chance At last he takes her by the bloodless hand And thus begins What uncouth ill event Hath thee befalln that thou dost trembling stand Sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent Why art thou thus attired in discontent Unmask dear dear this moody heaviness And tell thy grief that we may give redress Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire Ere once she can discharge one word of woe At length addressed to answer his desire She modestly prepares to let them know Her honour is taen prisoner by the foe While Collatine and his consorted lords With sad attention long to hear her words And now this pale swan in her watry nest Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending Few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best Where no excuse can give the fault amending In me more woes than words are now depending And my laments would be drawn out too long To tell them all with one poor tired tongue Then be this all the task it hath to say Dear husband in the interest of thy bed A stranger came and on that pillow lay Where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head And what wrong else may be imagined By foul enforcement might be done to me From that alas thy Lucrece is not free For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight With shining falchion in my chamber came A creeping creature with a flaming light And softly cried Awake thou Roman dame And entertain my love else lasting shame On thee and thine this night I will inflict If thou my loves desire do contradict For some hardfavoured groom of thine quoth he Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will Ill murder straight and then Ill slaughter thee And swear I found you where you did fulfil The loathsome act of lust and so did kill The lechers in their deed This act will be My fame and thy perpetual infamy With this I did begin to start and cry And then against my heart he sets his sword Swearing unless I took all patiently I should not live to speak another word So should my shame still rest upon record And never be forgot in mighty Rome The adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom Mine enemy was strong my poor self weak And far the weaker with so strong a fear My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak No rightful plea might plead for justice there His scarlet lust came evidence to swear That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes And when the judge is robbed the prisoner dies O teach me how to make mine own excuse Or at the least this refuge let me find Though my gross blood be stained with this abuse Immaculate and spotless is my mind That was not forced that never was inclined To accessary yieldings but still pure Doth in her poisoned closet yet endure Lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss With head declined and voice dammed up with woe With sad set eyes and wretched arms across From lips newwaxen pale begins to blow The grief away that stops his answer so But wretched as he is he strives in vain What he breathes out his breath drinks up again As through an arch the violent roaring tide Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride Back to the strait that forced him on so fast In rage sent out recalled in rage being past Even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw To push grief on and back the same grief draw Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh Dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth Another power no flood by raining slaketh My woe too sensible thy passion maketh More feelingpainful Let it then suffice To drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes And for my sake when I might charm thee so For she that was thy Lucrece now attend me Be suddenly revenged on my foe Thine mine his own Suppose thou dost defend me From what is past The help that thou shalt lend me Comes all too late yet let the traitor die For sparing justice feeds iniquity But ere I name him you fair lords quoth she Speaking to those that came with Collatine Shall plight your honourable faiths to me With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine For tis a meritorious fair design To chase injustice with revengeful arms Knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms At this request with noble disposition Each present lord began to promise aid As bound in knighthood to her imposition Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed But she that yet her sad task hath not said The protestation stops O speak quoth she How may this forced stain be wiped from me What is the quality of my offence Being constrained with dreadful circumstance May my pure mind with the foul act dispense My lowdeclined honour to advance May any terms acquit me from this chance The poisoned fountain clears itself again And why not I from this compelled stain With this they all at once began to say Her bodys stain her mind untainted clears While with a joyless smile she turns away The face that map which deep impression bears Of hard misfortune carved in it with tears No no quoth she no dame hereafter living By my excuse shall claim excuses giving Here with a sigh as if her heart would break She throws forth Tarquins name He he she says But more than he her poor tongue could not speak Till after many accents and delays Untimely breathings sick and short assays She utters this He he fair lords tis he That guides this hand to give this wound to me Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast A harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed That blow did bail it from the deep unrest Of that polluted prison where it breathed Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed Her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly Lifes lasting date from cancelled destiny Stonestill astonished with this deadly deed Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew Till Lucrece father that beholds her bleed Himself on her selfslaughtered body threw And from the purple fountain Brutus drew The murdrous knife and as it left the place Her blood in poor revenge held it in chase And bubbling from her breast it doth divide In two slow rivers that the crimson blood Circles her body in on every side Who like a latesacked island vastly stood Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood Some of her blood still pure and red remained And some looked black and that false Tarquin stained About the mourning and congealed face Of that black blood a watry rigol goes Which seems to weep upon the tainted place And ever since as pitying Lucrece woes Corrupted blood some watery token shows And blood untainted still doth red abide Blushing at that which is so putrified Daughter dear daughter old Lucretius cries That life was mine which thou hast here deprived If in the child the fathers image lies Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived Thou wast not to this end from me derived If children predecease progenitors We are their offspring and they none of ours Poor broken glass I often did behold In thy sweet semblance my old age new born But now that fair fresh mirror dim and old Shows me a bareboned death by time outworn O from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn And shivered all the beauty of my glass That I no more can see what once I was O time cease thou thy course and last no longer If they surcease to be that should survive Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger And leave the faltring feeble souls alive The old bees die the young possess their hive Then live sweet Lucrece live again and see Thy father die and not thy father thee By this starts Collatine as from a dream And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place And then in keycold Lucrece bleeding stream He falls and bathes the pale fear in his face And counterfeits to die with her a space Till manly shame bids"

who parted either part LADY MONTAGUE O where is Romeo saw you him today Right glad I am he was not at this fray BENVOLIO Madam an hour before the worshippd sun Peerd forth the golden window of the east A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad Where underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from this city side So early walking did I see your son Towards him I made but he was ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood I measuring his affections by my own Which then most sought where most might not be found Being one too many by my weary self Pursud my humour not pursuing his And gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me MONTAGUE Many a morning hath he there been seen With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs But all so soon as the allcheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Auroras bed Away from light steals home my heavy son And private in his chamber pens himself Shuts up his windows locks fair daylight out And makes himself an artificial night Black and portentous must this humour prove Unless good counsel may the cause remove BENVOLIO My noble uncle do you know the cause MONTAGUE I neither know it nor can learn of him BENVOLIO Have you importund him by any means MONTAGUE Both by myself and many other friends But he his own affections counsellor Is to himselfI will not say how true But to himself so secret and so close So far from sounding and discovery As is the bud bit with an envious worm Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air Or dedicate his beauty to the sun Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow We would as willingly give cure as know Enter Romeo BENVOLIO See where he comes So please you step aside Ill know his grievance or be much denied

fail in fortune of my choice Immediately to leave you and be gone PORTIA To these injunctions everyone doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self ARRAGON And so have I addressd me Fortune now To my hearts hope Gold silver and base lead Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard What says the golden chest Ha let me see Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire What many men desire that many may be meant By the fool multitude that choose by show Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach Which pries not to th interior but like the martlet Builds in the weather on the outward wall Even in the force and road of casualty I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes Why then to thee thou silver treasurehouse Tell me once more what title thou dost bear Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves And well said too for who shall go about To cozen fortune and be honourable Without the stamp of merit Let none presume To wear an undeserved dignity O that estates degrees and offices Were not derivd corruptly and that clear honour Were purchasd by the merit of the wearer How many then should cover that stand bare How many be commanded that command How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honour And how much honour Pickd from the chaff and ruin of the times To be new varnishd Well but to my choice Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves I will assume desert Give me a key for this And instantly unlock my fortunes here He opens the silver casket PORTIA Too long a pause for that which you find there ARRAGON Whats here The portrait of a blinking idiot Presenting me a schedule I will read it How much unlike art thou to Portia How much unlike my hopes and my deservings Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves Did I deserve no more than a fools head Is that my prize Are my

amiss Some there be that shadows kiss Such have but a shadows bliss There be fools alive I wis Silverd oer and so was this Take what wife you will to bed I will ever be your head So be gone you are

Will you sit down And uncle Worcester A plague upon it I have forgot the map GLENDOWER No here it is Sit cousin Percy sit good cousin Hotspur For by that name as oft as Lancaster doth speak of you His cheek looks pale and with a rising sigh He wisheth you in heaven HOTSPUR And you in hell As oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of GLENDOWER I cannot blame him At my nativity The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes Of burning cressets and at my birth The frame and huge foundation of the Earth Shaked like a coward HOTSPUR Why so it would have done At the same season if your mothers cat Had but kittend though yourself had never been born GLENDOWER I say the Earth did shake when I was born HOTSPUR And I say the Earth was not of my mind If you suppose as fearing you it shook GLENDOWER The heavens were all on fire the Earth did tremble HOTSPUR O then th Earth shook to see the heavens on fire And not in fear of your nativity Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth In strange eruptions oft the teeming Earth Is with a kind of colic pinchd and vexd By the imprisoning of unruly wind Within her womb which for enlargement striving Shakes the old beldam Earth and topples down Steeples and mossgrown towers At your birth Our grandam Earth having this distemprature In passion shook GLENDOWER Cousin of many men I do not bear these crossings Give me leave To tell you once again that at my birth The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes The goats ran from the mountains and the herds Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields These signs have markd me extraordinary And all the courses of my life do show I am not in the roll of common men Where is he living clippd in with the sea That chides the banks of England Scotland Wales Which calls me pupil or hath read to me And bring him out that is but womans son Can trace me in the tedious ways of art And hold me pace in deep experiments HOTSPUR I think there is no man speaks better Welsh Ill to dinner MORTIMER Peace cousin Percy you will make him mad GLENDOWER I can call spirits from the vasty deep HOTSPUR Why so can I or so can any man But will they come when you do call for them GLENDOWER Why I can teach you cousin to command the devil HOTSPUR And I can teach thee coz to shame the devil By telling truth tell truth and shame the devil If thou have power to raise him bring him hither And Ill be sworn I have power to shame him hence O while you live tell truth and shame the devil MORTIMER Come come no more of this unprofitable chat GLENDOWER Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head Against my power thrice from the banks of Wye And sandybottomd Severn have I sent him Bootless home and weatherbeaten back HOTSPUR Home without boots and in foul weather too How scapes he agues in the devils name GLENDOWER Come heres the map shall we divide our right According to our threefold order taen MORTIMER The archdeacon hath divided it Into three limits very equally England from Trent and Severn hitherto By south and east is to my part assignd All westward Wales beyond the Severn shore And all the fertile land within that bound To Owen Glendower and dear coz to you The remnant northward lying off from Trent And our indentures tripartite are drawn Which being sealed interchangeably A business that this night may execute Tomorrow cousin Percy you and I And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth To meet your father and the Scottish power As is appointed us at Shrewsbury My father Glendower is not ready yet Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days To Glendower Within that space you may have drawn together Your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen GLENDOWER A shorter time shall send me to you lords And in my conduct shall your ladies come From whom you now must steal and take no leave For there will be a world of water shed Upon the parting of your wives and you HOTSPUR Methinks my moiety north from Burton here In quantity equals not one of yours See how this river comes me cranking in And cuts me from the best of all my land A huge halfmoon a monstrous cantle out Ill have the current in this place dammed up And here the smug and silver Trent shall run In a new channel fair and evenly It shall not wind with such a deep indent To rob me of so rich a bottom here GLENDOWER Not wind It shall it must You see it doth MORTIMER Yea but mark how he bears his course and runs me up With like advantage on the other side Gelding the opposed continent as much As on the other side it takes from you WORCESTER Yea but a little charge will trench him here And on this north side win this cape of land And then he runs straight and even HOTSPUR Ill have it so a little charge will do it GLENDOWER Ill not have it altered HOTSPUR Will not you GLENDOWER No nor you shall not HOTSPUR Who shall say me nay GLENDOWER Why that will I HOTSPUR Let me not understand you then speak it in Welsh GLENDOWER I can speak English lord as well as you For I was traind up in the English Court Where being but young I framed to the harp Many an English ditty lovely well And gave the tongue a helpful ornament A virtue that was never seen in you HOTSPUR Marry and I am glad of it with all my heart I had rather be a kitten and cry mew Than one of these same metre balladmongers I had rather hear a brazen canstick turnd Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree And that would set my teeth nothing on edge Nothing so much as mincing poetry Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag GLENDOWER Come you shall have Trent turnd HOTSPUR I do not care Ill give thrice so much land To any welldeserving friend But in the way of bargain mark ye me Ill cavil on the ninth part of a hair Are the indentures drawn Shall we be gone GLENDOWER The moon shines fair you may away by night Ill haste the writer and withal Break with your wives of your departure hence I am afraid my daughter will run mad So much she doteth on her Mortimer Exit MORTIMER Fie cousin Percy how you cross my father HOTSPUR I cannot choose Sometimes he angers me With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies And of a dragon and a finless fish A clipwingd griffin and a moulten raven A couching lion and a ramping cat And such a deal of skimbleskamble stuff As puts me from my faith I tell you what He held me last night at least nine hours In reckoning up the several devils names That were his lackeys I cried Hum and Well go to But markd him not a word O he is as tedious As a tired horse a railing wife Worse than a smoky house I had rather live With cheese and garlic in a windmill far Than feed on cates and have him talk to me In any summer house in Christendom MORTIMER In faith he is a worthy gentleman Exceedingly well read and profited In strange concealments valiant as a lion And wondrous affable and as bountiful As mines of India Shall I tell you cousin He holds your temper in a high respect And curbs himself even of his natural scope When you come cross his humour faith he does I warrant you that man is not alive Might so have tempted him as you have done Without the taste of danger and reproof But do not use it oft let me entreat you WORCESTER In faith my lord you are too wilfulblame And since your coming hither have done enough To put him quite besides his patience You must needs learn lord to amend this fault Though sometimes it show greatness courage blood And thats the dearest grace it renders you Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage Defect of manners want of government Pride haughtiness opinion and disdain The least of which haunting a nobleman Loseth mens hearts and leaves behind a stain Upon the beauty of all parts besides Beguiling them of commendation HOTSPUR Well I am schoold Good manners be your speed Here come our wives and let us take our leave Enter Glendower with Lady Mortimer and Lady Percy MORTIMER This is the deadly spite that angers me My wife can speak no English I no Welsh GLENDOWER My daughter weeps shell not part with you Shell be a soldier too shell to the wars MORTIMER Good father tell her that she and my aunt Percy Shall follow in your conduct speedily Glendower speaks to Lady Mortimer in Welsh and she answers him in the same GLENDOWER She is desperate here a peevish selfwilled harlotry One that no persuasion can do good upon Lady Mortimer speaks to Mortimer in Welsh MORTIMER I understand thy looks that pretty Welsh Which thou pourest down from these swelling heavens I am too perfect in and but for shame In such a parley should I answer thee Lady Mortimer speaks to him again in Welsh I understand thy kisses and thou mine And thats a feeling disputation But I will never be a truant love Till I have learnt thy language for thy tongue Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly pennd Sung by a fair queen in a summers bower With ravishing"

grant this CAMILLO It is fifteen years since I saw my country Though I have for the most part been aired abroad I desire to lay my bones there Besides the penitent king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay or I oerween to think sowhich is another spur to my departure POLIXENES As thou lovst me Camillo wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now the need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made better not to have had thee than thus to want thee Thou having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if I have not enough considered as too much I cannot to be more thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the heaping friendships Of that fatal country Sicilia prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent as thou callst him and reconciled king my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented Say to me when sawest thou the Prince Florizel my son Kings are no less unhappy their issue not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues CAMILLO Sir it is three days since I saw the prince What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared POLIXENES I have considered so much Camillo and with some care so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom I have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate CAMILLO I have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage POLIXENES Thats likewise part of my intelligence but I fear the angle that plucks our son thither Thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing

for me and my aunts While we lie tumbling in the hay I have served Prince Florizel and in my time wore threepile but now I am out of service But shall I go mourn for that my dear The pale moon shines by night And when I wander here and there I then do most go right If tinkers may have leave to live And bear the sowskin budget Then my account I well may give And in the stocks avouch it My traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to lesser linen My father named me Autolycus who being I as am littered under Mercury was likewise a snapperup of unconsidered trifles With die and drab I purchased

sweet sir no I beseech you sir I have a kinsman not past threequarters of a mile hence unto whom I was going I shall there have money or anything I want Offer me no money I pray you that kills my heart CLOWN What manner of fellow was he that robbed you AUTOLYCUS A fellow sir that I have known to go about with trollmydames I knew him once a servant of the prince I cannot tell good sir for which of his virtues it was but he was certainly whipped out of the court CLOWN His vices you would say theres no virtue whipped out of the court They cherish it to make it stay there and yet it will no more but abide AUTOLYCUS Vices I would say sir I know this man well He hath been since an apebearer then a processserver a bailiff Then he compassed a motion of the Prodigal Son and married a tinkers

and walk I will even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsmans CLOWN Shall I bring thee on the way AUTOLYCUS No goodfaced sir no sweet sir CLOWN Then fare thee well I must go buy spices for our sheepshearing AUTOLYCUS Prosper you sweet sir Exit Clown Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice Ill be with you at your sheepshearing too If I make not this cheat bring out

am in the favour of Margaret the waiting gentlewoman to Hero DON JOHN I remember BORACHIO I can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her ladys chamber window DON JOHN What life is in that to be the death of this marriage BORACHIO The poison of that lies in you to temper Go you to the Prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudiowhose estimation do you mightily hold upto a contaminated stale such a one as Hero DON JOHN What proof shall I make of that BORACHIO Proof enough to misuse the Prince to

me at her chamber window hear me call Margaret Hero hear Margaret term me Claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter

issue it can I will put it in practice Be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducats BORACHIO Be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me DON JOHN I will

orchard BOY I am here already sir BENEDICK I know that but I would have thee hence and here again Exit Boy I do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is Claudio I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes May I be so converted and see with these eyes I cannot tell I think not I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but Ill take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool One woman is fair yet I am well another is wise yet I am well another virtuous yet I am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace Rich she shall be thats certain wise or Ill none virtuous or Ill never cheapen her fair or Ill never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not I for an angel of good discourse

any more than once DON PEDRO It is the witness still of excellency To put a strange face on his own perfection I pray thee sing and let me woo no more BALTHASAR Because you talk of wooing I will sing Since many a wooer doth commence his suit To her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes Yet will he swear he loves DON PEDRO Nay pray thee come Or if thou wilt hold longer argument Do it in notes BALTHASAR Note this before my notes Theres not a note of mine thats worth the noting DON PEDRO Why these are very crotchets that he speaks Notes notes forsooth and nothing Music BENEDICK Now divine air now is his soul ravished Is it not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out of mens bodies Well a horn for my money when alls done BALTHASAR sings Sigh no more ladies sigh no more Men were deceivers ever One foot in sea and one on shore To one thing constant never Then sigh not so but let them go And be you blithe and bonny Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny nonny Sing no more ditties sing no mo Of dumps so dull and heavy The fraud of men was ever so Since summer first was leavy Then sigh not so but let them go And be you blithe and bonny Converting all your sounds of woe

backing of the Duke of York And in the towns as they do march along Proclaims him king and many fly to him Darraign your battle for they are at hand CLIFFORD I would your highness would depart the field The Queen hath best success when you are absent QUEEN MARGARET Ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune KING HENRY Why thats my fortune too therefore Ill stay NORTHUMBERLAND Be it with resolution then to fight PRINCE EDWARD My royal father cheer these noble lords And hearten those that fight in your defence Unsheathe your sword good father cry Saint George March Enter Edward George Richard Warwick Norfolk Montague and Soldiers EDWARD Now perjured Henry wilt thou kneel for grace And set thy diadem upon my head Or bide the mortal fortune of the field QUEEN MARGARET Go rate thy minions proud insulting boy Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king EDWARD I am his king and he should bow his knee I was adopted heir by his consent Since when his oath is broke for as I hear You that are king though he do wear the crown Have caused him by new act of Parliament To blot out me and put his own son in CLIFFORD And reason too Who should succeed the father but the son RICHARD Are you there butcher O I cannot speak CLIFFORD Ay crookback here I stand to answer thee Or any he the proudest of thy sort RICHARD Twas you that killed young Rutland was it not CLIFFORD Ay and old York and yet not satisfied RICHARD For Gods sake lords give signal to the fight WARWICK What sayst thou Henry wilt thou yield the crown QUEEN MARGARET Why how now longtongued Warwick dare you speak When you and I met at Saint Albans last Your legs did better service than your hands WARWICK Then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine CLIFFORD You said so much before and yet you fled WARWICK Twas not your valour Clifford drove me thence NORTHUMBERLAND No nor your manhood that durst make you stay RICHARD Northumberland I hold thee reverently Break off the parley for scarce I can refrain The execution of my bigswoln heart Upon that Clifford that cruel childkiller CLIFFORD I slew thy father callst thou him a child RICHARD Ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland But ere sunset Ill make thee curse the deed KING HENRY Have done with words my lords and hear me speak QUEEN MARGARET Defy them then or else hold close thy lips KING HENRY I prithee give no limits to my tongue I am a king and privileged to speak CLIFFORD My liege the wound that bred this meeting here Cannot be cured by words therefore

broke their fasts today That neer shall dine unless thou yield the crown WARWICK If thou deny their blood upon thy head For York in justice puts his armour on PRINCE EDWARD If that be right which Warwick says is right There is no wrong but everything is right RICHARD Whoever got thee there thy mother stands For well I wot thou hast thy mothers tongue QUEEN MARGARET But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam But like a foul misshapen stigmatic Marked by the Destinies to be avoided As venom toads or lizards dreadful stings RICHARD Iron of Naples hid with English gilt Whose father bears the title of a king As if a channel should be called the sea Shamst thou not knowing whence thou art extraught To let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart EDWARD A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns To make this shameless callet know herself Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou Although thy husband may be Menelaus And neer was Agamemnons brother wronged By that false woman as this king by thee His father revelled in the heart of France And tamed the King and made the Dauphin stoop And had he matched according to his state He might have kept that glory to this day But when he took a beggar to his bed And graced thy poor sire with his bridal day Even then that sunshine brewed a shower for him That washed his fathers fortunes forth of France And heaped sedition on his crown at home For what hath broached this tumult but thy pride Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept And we in pity of the gentle king Had slipped our claim until another age GEORGE But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring And that thy summer bred us no increase We set the axe to thy usurping root And though the edge hath something hit ourselves Yet know thou since we have begun to strike Well never leave till we have hewn thee down Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods EDWARD And in this resolution I defy thee Not willing any longer conference Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak Sound trumpets Let our bloody colours wave And either victory or else a grave QUEEN MARGARET Stay Edward EDWARD No wrangling woman well no longer stay These words will cost ten thousand lives this day Exeunt SCENE III A field of battle between Towton and Saxton in Yorkshire Alarums Excursions Enter Warwick WARWICK Forspent with toil as runners with a race I lay me down a little while to breathe For strokes received and many blows repaid Have robbed my strongknit sinews of their strength And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile Enter Edward running EDWARD Smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death For this world frowns and Edwards sun is clouded WARWICK How now my lord what hap What hope of good Enter George GEORGE Our hap is loss our hope but sad despair Our ranks are broke and ruin follows us What counsel give you Whither shall we fly EDWARD Bootless is flight they follow us with wings And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit Enter Richard RICHARD Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself Thy brothers blood the thirsty earth hath drunk Broached with the steely point of Cliffords lance And in the very pangs of death he cried Like to a dismal clangor heard from far Warwick revenge Brother revenge my death So underneath the belly of their steeds That stained their fetlocks in his smoking blood The noble gentleman gave up the ghost WARWICK Then let the earth be drunken with our blood Ill kill my horse because I will not fly Why stand we like softhearted women here Wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage And look upon as if the tragedy Were played in jest by counterfeiting actors Here on my knee I vow to God above Ill never pause again never stand still Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine Or Fortune given me measure of revenge EDWARD O Warwick I do bend my knee with thine And in this vow do chain my soul to thine And ere my knee rise from the earths cold face I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to Thee Thou setter up and plucker down of kings Beseeching Thee if with Thy will it stands That to my foes this body must be prey Yet that Thy brazen gates of heaven may ope And give sweet passage to my sinful soul Now lords take leave until we meet again Whereer it be in heaven or in earth RICHARD Brother give me thy hand and gentle Warwick Let me embrace thee in my weary arms I that did never weep now melt with woe That winter should cut off our springtime so WARWICK Away away Once more sweet lords farewell GEORGE Yet let us all together to our troops And give them leave to fly that will not stay And call them pillars that will stand to us And if we thrive promise them such rewards As victors wear at the Olympian games This may plant courage in their quailing breasts For yet is hope of life and victory Forslow no longer make we hence amain Exeunt SCENE IV Another Part of the Field Excursions Enter Richard and Clifford RICHARD Now Clifford I have singled thee alone Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York And this for Rutland both bound to revenge Wert thou environed with a brazen wall CLIFFORD Now Richard I am with thee here alone This is the hand that stabbed thy father York And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland And heres the heart that triumphs in their death And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother To execute the like upon thyself And so have at thee They fight Warwick comes Clifford flies RICHARD Nay Warwick single out some other chase For I myself will hunt this wolf to death Exeunt SCENE V Another Part of the Field Enter King Henry KING HENRY This battle fares like to the mornings war When dying clouds contend with growing light What time the shepherd blowing of his nails Can neither call it perfect day nor night Now sways it this way like a mighty sea Forced by the tide to combat with the wind Now sways it that way like the selfsame sea Forced to retire by fury of the wind Sometime the flood prevails and then the wind Now one the better then another best Both tugging to be victors breast to breast Yet neither conqueror nor conquered So is the equal poise of this fell war Here on this molehill will I sit me down To whom God will there be the victory For Margaret my queen and Clifford too Have chid me from the battle swearing both They prosper best of all when I am thence Would I were dead if Gods good will were so For what is in this world but grief and woe O God Methinks it were a happy life To be no better than a homely swain To sit upon a hill as I do now To carve out dials quaintly point by point Thereby to see the minutes how they run How many make the hour full complete How many hours brings about the day How many days will finish up the year How many years a mortal man may live When this is known then to divide the times So many hours must I tend my flock So many hours must I take my rest So many hours must I contemplate So many hours must I sport myself So many days my ewes have been with young So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean So many years ere I shall shear the fleece So minutes hours days months and years Passed over to the end they were created Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave Ah what a life were this How sweet how lovely Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade To shepherds looking on their silly sheep Than doth a rich embroidered canopy To kings that fear their subjects treachery O yes it doth a thousandfold it doth And to conclude the shepherds homely curds His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle His wonted sleep under a fresh trees shade All which secure and sweetly he enjoys Is far beyond a princes delicates His viands sparkling in a golden cup His body couched in a curious bed When care mistrust and treason waits on him Alarum Enter a Son that hath killed his father bringing in the dead body SON Ill blows the wind that profits nobody This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight May be possessed with some store of crowns And I that haply take them from him now May yet ere night yield both my life and them To some man else as this dead man doth me Whos this O God It is my fathers face Whom in this conflict I unwares have killed O heavy times begetting such events From London by the King was I pressed forth My father being the Earl of Warwicks man Came on the part of York pressed by his master And I who at his hands received my life Have by my hands of life bereaved him Pardon me God I knew not what I did And pardon father for I knew not thee My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks And no more words till"

determinate resolution he I mean the Bishop did require a respite Wherein he might the King his lord advertise Whether our daughter were legitimate Respecting this our marriage with the dowager Sometimes our brothers wife This respite shook The bosom of my conscience entered me Yea with a splitting power and made to tremble The region of my breast which forced such way That many mazed considerings did throng And pressed in with this caution First methought I stood not in the smile of heaven who had Commanded nature that my ladys womb If it conceived a male child by me should Do no more offices of life tot than The grave does to th dead for her male issue Or died where they were made or shortly after This world had aired them Hence I took a thought This was a judgement on me

commanders names and they will learn you by rote where services were done at such and such a sconce at such a breach at such a convoy who came off bravely who was shot who disgracd what terms the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war which they trick up with newtuned oaths and what a beard of the generals cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles

volant the Pegasus qui a les narines de feu When I bestride him I soar I am a hawk He trots the air the earth sings when he touches it the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes ORLEANS Hes of the colour of the nutmeg DAUPHIN And of the heat of the ginger It is a beast for Perseus He is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him He is indeed a horse and all other jades you may call beasts CONSTABLE Indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse DAUPHIN It is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage ORLEANS No more cousin DAUPHIN Nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey It is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereigns sovereign to ride on and for the world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus Wonder of nature ORLEANS I have heard a sonnet begin so to ones mistress DAUPHIN Then did they imitate that which I composd to my courser for my horse is my mistress ORLEANS Your mistress bears well DAUPHIN Me well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress CONSTABLE Nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back DAUPHIN So perhaps did yours CONSTABLE Mine was not bridled DAUPHIN O then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a kern of Ireland your French hose off and in your strait strossers CONSTABLE You have good judgment in horsemanship DAUPHIN Be warnd by me then they that ride so and ride not warily fall into foul bogs I had rather have my horse to my mistress CONSTABLE I had as lief have my mistress a jade DAUPHIN I tell thee Constable my mistress wears his own hair CONSTABLE I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress DAUPHIN Le chien est retourn son propre vomissement et la truie lave au bourbier Thou makst use of anything CONSTABLE Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose RAMBURES My Lord Constable the armour that I saw in your tent tonight are those stars or suns upon it CONSTABLE Stars my lord DAUPHIN Some of them will fall tomorrow I hope CONSTABLE And yet my sky shall not want DAUPHIN That may be for you bear a many superfluously and twere more honour some were away CONSTABLE Even as your horse bears your praises who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted DAUPHIN Would I were able to load him with his desert Will it never be day I will trot tomorrow a mile and my way shall be paved with English faces CONSTABLE I will not say so for fear I should be facd out of my way But I would it were morning for I would fain be about the ears of the English RAMBURES Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners CONSTABLE You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them DAUPHIN Tis midnight Ill go arm myself Exit ORLEANS The Dauphin longs for morning RAMBURES He longs to eat the English CONSTABLE I think he will eat all he kills ORLEANS By the white hand of my lady hes a gallant prince CONSTABLE Swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath ORLEANS He is simply the most active gentleman of France CONSTABLE Doing is activity and he will still be doing ORLEANS He never did harm that I heard of CONSTABLE Nor will do none tomorrow He will keep that good name still ORLEANS I know him to be valiant CONSTABLE I was told that by one that knows him better than you ORLEANS Whats he CONSTABLE Marry he told me so himself and he said he card not who knew it ORLEANS He needs not it is no hidden virtue in him CONSTABLE By my faith sir but it is never anybody saw it but his lackey Tis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bate ORLEANS Ill will never said well CONSTABLE I will cap that proverb with There is flattery in friendship ORLEANS And I will take up that with Give the devil his due CONSTABLE Well placd There stands your friend for the devil have at the very eye of that proverb with A pox of the devil ORLEANS You are the better at proverbs by how much A fools bolt is soon shot CONSTABLE You have shot over ORLEANS Tis not the first time you were overshot Enter a Messenger MESSENGER My Lord High Constable the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents CONSTABLE Who hath measurd the ground MESSENGER The Lord Grandpr CONSTABLE A valiant and most expert gentleman Would it were day Alas poor Harry of England he longs not for the dawning as we do ORLEANS What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of England to mope with his fatbraind followers so far out of his knowledge CONSTABLE If the English had any apprehension they would run away ORLEANS That they lack for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy headpieces RAMBURES That island of England breeds very valiant creatures Their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage ORLEANS Foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushd like rotten apples You may as well say thats a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion CONSTABLE Just just and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel they will eat like wolves and fight like devils ORLEANS Ay but these English are shrewdly out of beef CONSTABLE Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight Now is it time to arm Come shall we about it ORLEANS It is now two oclock but let me see by ten We shall have each a hundred Englishmen Exeunt ACT IV Enter Chorus CHORUS Now entertain conjecture of a time When creeping murmur and the poring dark Fills the wide vessel of the universe From camp to camp through the foul womb of night The hum of either army stilly sounds That the fixd sentinels almost receive The secret whispers of each others watch Fire answers fire and through their paly flames Each battle sees the others umberd face Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs Piercing the nights dull ear and from the tents The armourers accomplishing the knights With busy hammers closing rivets up Give dreadful note of preparation The country cocks do crow the clocks do toll And the third hour of drowsy morning name Proud of their numbers and secure in soul The confident and overlusty French Do the lowrated English play at dice And chide the cripple tardygaited Night Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp So tediously away The poor condemned English Like sacrifices by their watchful fires Sit patiently and inly ruminate The mornings danger and their gesture sad Investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats Presented them unto the gazing moon So many horrid ghosts O now who will behold The royal captain of this ruind band Walking from watch to watch from tent to tent Let him cry Praise and glory on his head For forth he goes and visits all his host Bids them good morrow with a modest smile And calls them brothers friends and countrymen Upon his royal face there is no note How dread an army hath enrounded him Nor doth he dedicate one"

151 These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky From morn till night even where I list to sport me Is love so light sweet boy and may it be That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee 156 Is thine own heart to thine own face affected Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left Then woo thyself be of thyself rejected Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft 160 Narcissus so himself himself forsook And died to kiss his shadow in the brook Torches are made to light jewels to wear Dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use 164 Herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear Things growing to themselves are growths abuse Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty Thou wast begot to get it is thy duty 168 Upon the earths increase why shouldst thou feed Unless the earth with thy increase be fed By law of nature thou art bound to breed That thine may live when thou thyself art dead 172 And so in spite of death thou dost survive In that thy likeness still is left alive By this the lovesick queen began to sweat For where they lay the shadow had forsook them 176 And Titan tired in the midday heat With burning eye did hotly overlook them Wishing Adonis had his team to guide So he were like him and by Venus side 180 And now Adonis with a lazy spright And with a heavy dark disliking eye His louring brows oerwhelming his fair sight Like misty vapours when they blot the sky 184 Souring his cheeks cries Fie no more of love The sun doth burn my face I must remove Ay me quoth Venus young and so unkind What bare excuses makst thou to be gone 188 Ill sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind Shall cool the heat of this descending sun Ill make a shadow for thee of my hairs If they burn too Ill quench them with my tears 192 The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm And lo I lie between that sun and thee The heat I have from thence doth little harm Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me 196 And were I not immortal life were done Between this heavenly and earthly sun Art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel Nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth 200 Art thou a womans son and canst not feel What tis to love how want of love tormenteth O had thy mother borne so hard a mind She had not brought forth thee but died unkind 204 What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this Or what great danger dwells upon my suit What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss Speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute 208 Give me one kiss Ill give it thee again And one for intrest if thou wilt have twain Fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone Wellpainted idol image dull and dead 212 Statue contenting but the eye alone Thing like a man but of no woman bred Thou art no man though of a mans complexion For men will kiss even by their own direction 216 This said impatience chokes her pleading tongue And swelling passion doth provoke a pause Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong Being judge in love she cannot right her cause 220 And now she weeps and now she fain would speak And now her sobs do her intendments break Sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand Now gazeth she on him now on the ground 224 Sometimes her arms infold him like a band She would he will not in her arms be bound And when from thence he struggles to be gone She locks her lily fingers one in one 228 Fondling she saith since I have hemmd thee here Within the circuit of this ivory pale Ill be a park and thou shalt be my deer Feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale 232 Graze on my lips and if those hills be dry Stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie Within this limit is relief enough Sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain 236 Round rising hillocks brakes obscure and rough To shelter thee from tempest and from rain Then be my deer since I am such a park 239 No dog shall rouse thee though a thousand bark At this Adonis smiles as in disdain That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple Love made those hollows if himself were slain He might be buried in a tomb so simple 244 Foreknowing well if there he came to lie Why there love livd and there he could not die These lovely caves these round enchanting pits Opend their mouths to swallow Venus liking 248 Being mad before how doth she now for wits Struck dead at first what needs a second striking Poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn 252 Now which way shall she turn what shall she say Her words are done her woes the more increasing The time is spent her object will away And from her twining arms doth urge releasing 256 Pity she cries some favour some remorse Away he springs and hasteth to his horse But lo from forth a copse that neighbours by A breeding jennet lusty young and proud 260 Adonis tramping courser doth espy And forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud The strongneckd steed being tied unto a tree Breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he 264 Imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds And now his woven girths he breaks asunder The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds Whose hollow womb resounds like heavens thunder The iron bit he crusheth tween his teeth 269 Controlling what he was controlled with His ears upprickd his braided hanging mane Upon his compassd crest now stand on end 272 His nostrils drink the air and forth again As from a furnace vapours doth he send His eye which scornfully glisters like fire Shows his hot courage and his high desire 276 Sometime he trots as if he told the steps With gentle majesty and modest pride Anon he rears upright curvets and leaps As who should say Lo thus my strength is tried And this I do to captivate the eye 281 Of the fair breeder that is standing by What recketh he his riders angry stir His flattering Holla or his Stand I say 284 What cares he now for curb or pricking spur For rich caparisons or trappings gay He sees his love and nothing else he sees For nothing else with his proud sight agrees 288 Look when a painter would surpass the life In limning out a wellproportiond steed His art with natures workmanship at strife As if the dead the living should exceed 292 So did this horse excel a common one In shape in courage colour pace and bone Roundhoofd shortjointed fetlocks shag and long Broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide High crest short ears straight legs and passing strong Thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide Look what a horse should have he did not lack Save a proud rider on so proud a back 300 Sometimes he scuds far off and there he stares Anon he starts at stirring of a feather To bid the wind a base he now prepares And where he run or fly they know not whether 304 For through his mane and tail the high wind sings Fanning the hairs who wave like featherd wings He looks upon his love and neighs unto her She answers him as if she knew his mind 308 Being proud as females are to see him woo her She puts on outward strangeness seems unkind Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels Beating his kind embracements with her heels 312 Then like a melancholy malcontent He vails his tail that like a falling plume Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume 316 His love perceiving how he was enragd Grew kinder and his fury was assuagd His testy master goeth about to take him When lo the unbackd breeder full of fear 320 Jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him With her the horse and left Adonis there As they were mad unto the wood they hie them Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them 324 All swoln with chafing down Adonis sits Banning his boisterous and unruly beast And now the happy season once more fits That lovesick love by pleading may be blest 328 For lovers say the heart hath treble wrong When it is barrd the aidance of the tongue An oven that is stoppd or river stayd Burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage 332 So of concealed sorrow may be said Free vent of words loves fire doth assuage But when the hearts attorney once is mute The client breaks as desperate in his suit 336 He sees her coming and begins to glow Even as a dying coal revives with wind And with his bonnet hides his angry brow Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind 340 Taking no notice that she is so nigh For all askance he holds her in his eye O what a sight it was wistly to view How she came stealing to the wayward boy 344 To note the fighting conflict of her hue How white and red each other did destroy But now her cheek was pale and by and by It flashd forth fire as lightning from the sky 348 Now was she just before him as he sat And like a lowly lover down she kneels With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels 352 His tendrer cheek receives her soft hands print As apt as newfalln snow takes any dint Oh what a war of looks was then between them Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing 356 His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them Her eyes wood still his eyes disdaind the wooing And all this dumb play had his acts made plain With tears which choruslike her eyes did rain Full gently now she takes him by the hand 361 A lily prisond in a gaol of snow Or ivory in an alabaster band So white a friend engirts so white a foe 364 This beauteous combat wilful and unwilling Showd like two silver doves that sit abilling Once more the engine of her thoughts began O fairest mover on this mortal round 368 Would thou wert as I am and I a man My heart all whole as thine thy heart my wound For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee Though nothing but my bodys bane would cure thee Give me my hand saith he why dost thou feel it Give me my heart saith she and thou shalt have it O give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it And being steeld soft sighs can never grave it 376 Then loves deep groans I never shall regard Because Adonis heart hath made mine hard For shame he cries let go and let me go My days delight is past my horse is gone 380 And tis your fault I am bereft him so I pray you hence and leave me here alone For all my mind my thought my busy care Is how to get my palfrey from the mare 384 Thus she replies Thy palfrey as he should Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire Affection is a coal that must be coold Else sufferd it will set the heart on fire 388 The sea hath bounds but deep desire hath none Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone How like a jade he stood tied to the tree Servilely masterd with a leathern rein 392 But when he saw his love his youths fair fee He held such petty bondage in disdain Throwing the base thong from his bending crest Enfranchising his mouth his back his breast 396 Who sees his truelove in her naked bed Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white But when his glutton eye so full hath fed His other agents aim at like delight 400 Who is so faint that dare not be so bold To touch the fire the weather being cold Let me excuse thy courser gentle boy And learn of him I heartily beseech thee 404 To take advantage on presented joy Though I were dumb yet his proceedings teach thee O learn to love the lesson is but plain And once made perfect never lost again 408 I know not love quoth he nor will not know it Unless it be a boar and then I chase it Tis much to borrow and I will not owe it My love to love is love but to disgrace it 412 For I have heard it is a life in death That laughs and weeps and all but with a breath Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinishd Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth 416 If springing things be any jot diminishd They wither in their prime prove nothing worth The colt thats backd and burdend being young Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong 420 You hurt my hand with wringing Let us part And leave this idle theme this bootless chat Remove your siege from my unyielding heart To loves alarms it will not ope the gate 424 Dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattry For where a heart is hard they make no battry What canst thou talk quoth she hast thou a tongue O would thou hadst not or I had no hearing 428 Thy mermaids voice hath done me double wrong I had my load before now pressd with bearing Melodious discord heavenly tune harshsounding Ears deep sweet music and hearts deep sore wounding Had"

bald with dry antiquity A wretched ragged man oergrown with hair Lay sleeping on his back about his neck A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself Who with her head nimble in threats approached The opening of his mouth But suddenly Seeing Orlando it unlinked itself And with indented glides did slip away Into a bush under which bushs shade A lioness with udders all drawn dry Lay couching head on

of grief Yet gracious madam bear it as you may Warwick may lose that now hath won the day QUEEN ELIZABETH Till then fair hope must hinder lifes decay And I the rather wean me from despair For love of

makes him nothing I must read this paper I fear the story of his anger Tis so This paper has undone me Tis th account Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together For mine own endsindeed to gain

bewailing land Of noble Buckingham my fatherinlaw The heads of all thy brother cardinals With thee and all thy best parts bound together Weighed not a hair of his Plague of your policy You sent me Deputy for Ireland Far from his succour from the King from all That might have mercy on the fault thou gavst him Whilst your great goodness out of holy pity Absolved him with an axe WOLSEY This and all else This talking lord can lay upon my credit I answer is most false The Duke by law Found his deserts How innocent I was From any private malice in his end His noble jury and foul cause can

spotless shall mine innocence arise When the King knows my truth SURREY This cannot save you I thank my memory I yet remember Some of these articles and out they shall Now if you can blush and cry Guilty Cardinal Youll show a little honesty WOLSEY Speak on sir I dare your worst objections If I blush It is to see a nobleman want manners SURREY I had rather want those than my head Have at you First that without the Kings assent or knowledge You wrought to be a legate by which power You maimed the jurisdiction of all bishops NORFOLK Then that in all you writ to Rome or else To foreign princes ego et rex meus Was still inscribed in which you brought the King To be your servant SUFFOLK Then that without the knowledge Either of King or Council when you went Ambassador to the Emperor you made bold To carry into Flanders the great seal SURREY Item you sent a large commission To Gregory de Cassado to conclude Without the Kings will or the states allowance A league between his

Cardinal Exeunt all but Wolsey WOLSEY So farewell to the little good you bear me Farewell A long farewell to all my greatness This is the state of man today he puts forth The tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms And bears his blushing honours thick upon him The third day comes a frost a killing frost And when he thinks good easy man full surely His greatness is aripening nips his root And then he falls as I do I have ventured Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders This many summers in a sea of glory But far beyond my depth My highblown pride At length broke under me and now has left me Weary and old with service to the mercy Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me Vain pomp and glory of this world I hate ye I feel my heart new opened O how wretched Is that poor man that hangs on princes favours There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to That sweet aspect of princes and their ruin More pangs and fears than wars or women have And when he falls he falls like Lucifer Never to hope again Enter Cromwell standing amazed Why how now Cromwell CROMWELL I have no power to speak sir WOLSEY What amazed At my misfortunes Can thy spirit wonder A great man should decline Nay an you weep I am fallen indeed CROMWELL How does your Grace WOLSEY Why well Never so truly happy my good Cromwell I know myself now and I feel within me A peace above all earthly dignities A still and quiet conscience The King has cured me I humbly thank his Grace and from these shoulders These ruined pillars out of pity taken A load would sink a navy too much honour O tis a burden Cromwell tis a burden Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven CROMWELL I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it WOLSEY I hope I have I am able now methinks Out of a fortitude of soul I feel To endure more miseries and greater far Than my weakhearted enemies dare offer What news abroad CROMWELL The heaviest and the worst Is your displeasure with the King WOLSEY God bless him CROMWELL The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen Lord Chancellor in your place WOLSEY Thats somewhat sudden But hes a learned man May he continue Long in his Highness favour and do justice For truths sake and his conscience that his bones When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings May have a tomb of orphans tears wept on him What more CROMWELL That Cranmer is returned with welcome Installed Lord Archbishop of Canterbury WOLSEY Thats news indeed CROMWELL Last that the Lady Anne Whom the King hath in secrecy long married This day was viewed in open as his Queen Going to chapel and the voice is now Only about her coronation WOLSEY There was the weight that pulled me down O Cromwell The King has gone beyond me All my glories In that one woman I have lost for ever No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours Or gild again the noble troops that waited Upon my smiles Go get thee from me Cromwell I am a poor fallen man unworthy now To be thy lord and master Seek the King That sun I pray may never set I have told him What and how true thou art He will advance thee Some little memory of me will stir him I know his noble naturenot to let Thy hopeful service perish too Good Cromwell Neglect him not make use now and provide For thine own future safety CROMWELL O my lord Must I then leave you Must I needs forgo So good so noble and so true a master Bear witness all that have not hearts of iron With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord The King shall have my service but my prayers For ever and for ever shall be yours WOLSEY Cromwell I did not think to shed a tear In all my miseries but thou hast forced me Out of thy honest truth to play the woman Lets dry our eyes and thus far hear me Cromwell And when I am forgotten as I shall be And sleep in dull cold marble where no mention Of me more must be heard of say I taught thee Say Wolsey that once trod the ways of glory And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour Found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in A sure and safe one though thy master missed it Mark but my fall and that that ruined me Cromwell I charge thee fling away ambition By that sin fell the angels how can man then The image of his maker hope to win by it Love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee Corruption wins not more than honesty Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace To silence envious tongues Be just and fear not Let all the ends thou aimst at be thy countrys Thy Gods and truths Then if thou fallst O Cromwell Thou fallst a blessed martyr Serve the King And prithee lead me in There take an inventory of all I have To the last penny tis the Kings My robe And my integrity to heaven is all I dare now call mine own O Cromwell Cromwell Had I but served my God with half the zeal I served my king He would not in mine age Have left me naked to mine enemies CROMWELL Good sir have patience WOLSEY So I have Farewell The hopes of court My hopes in heaven do dwell Exeunt ACT IV SCENE I A street in Westminster Enter two Gentlemen meeting one another FIRST GENTLEMAN Youre well met once again SECOND GENTLEMAN So are you FIRST GENTLEMAN You come to take your stand here and behold The Lady Anne pass from her coronation

SENATOR This cannot be By no assay of reason Tis a pageant To keep us in false gaze When we consider The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk And let ourselves again but understand That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes So may he with more facile question bear it For that it stands not in such warlike brace But altogether lacks the abilities That Rhodes is dressd in If we make thought of this We must not think the Turk is so unskilful To leave that latest which concerns him first Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain To wake and wage a danger profitless DUKE Nay in all confidence hes

Secure of thunders crack or lightnings flash Advanced above pale envys threatning reach As when the golden sun salutes the morn And having gilt the ocean with his beams Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach And overlooks the highestpeering hills So Tamora Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown Then Aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long Hast prisoner held fettred in amorous chains And faster bound to Aarons charming eyes Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold To wait upon this newmade empress To wait said I To wanton with this queen This goddess this Semiramis this nymph This siren that will charm Romes Saturnine And see his shipwrack and his commonweals Holla What storm is this Enter Chiron and Demetrius braving DEMETRIUS Chiron thy years wants wit thy wit wants edge And manners to intrude where I am graced And may for aught thou knowest affected be CHIRON Demetrius thou dost overween in all And so in this to bear me down with braves Tis not the difference of a year or two Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate I am as able and as fit as thou To serve and to deserve my mistress grace And that my sword upon thee shall approve And plead my passions for Lavinias love AARON Aside Clubs clubs These lovers will not keep the peace DEMETRIUS Why boy although our mother unadvised Gave you a dancingrapier by your side Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends Go to have your lath glued within your sheath Till you know better how to handle it CHIRON Meanwhile sir with the little skill I have Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare DEMETRIUS Ay boy grow ye so brave They draw AARON Why how now lords So near the emperors palace dare ye draw And maintain such a quarrel openly Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge I would not for a million of gold The cause were known to them it most concerns Nor would your noble mother for much more Be so dishonoured in the court of Rome For shame put up DEMETRIUS Not I till I have sheathed My rapier in his bosom and withal Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat That he hath breathed in my dishonour here CHIRON For that I am prepared and full resolved Foulspoken coward that thundrest with thy tongue And with thy weapon nothing darst perform AARON Away I say Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore This pretty brabble will undo us all Why lords and think you not how dangerous It is to jet upon a princes right What is Lavinia then become so loose Or Bassianus so degenerate That for her love such quarrels may be broached Without controlment justice or revenge Young lords beware And should the empress know This discords ground the music would not please CHIRON I care not I knew she and all the world I love Lavinia more than all the world DEMETRIUS Youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice Lavina is thine elder brothers hope AARON Why are ye mad Or know ye not in Rome How furious and impatient they be And cannot brook competitors in love I tell you lords you do but plot your deaths By this device CHIRON Aaron a thousand deaths Would I propose to achieve her whom I love AARON To achieve her How DEMETRIUS Why makes thou it so strange She is a woman therefore may be wooed She is a woman therefore may be won She is Lavinia therefore must be loved What man more water glideth by the mill Than wots the miller of and easy it is Of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know Though Bassianus be the emperors brother Better than he have worn Vulcans badge AARON Aside Ay and as good as Saturninus may DEMETRIUS Then why should he despair that knows to court it With words fair looks and liberality What hast not thou full often struck a doe And borne her cleanly by the keepers nose AARON Why then it seems some certain snatch or so Would serve your turns CHIRON Ay so the turn were served DEMETRIUS Aaron thou hast hit it AARON Would you had hit it too Then should not we be tired with this ado Why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools To square for this Would it offend you then That both should speed CHIRON Faith not me DEMETRIUS Nor me so I were one AARON For shame be friends and join for that you jar Tis policy and stratagem must do That you affect and so must you resolve That what you cannot as you would achieve You must perforce accomplish as you may Take this of me Lucrece was not more chaste Than this Lavinia Bassianus love A speedier course than lingring languishment Must we pursue and I have found the path My lords a solemn hunting is in hand There will the lovely Roman ladies troop The forest walks are wide and spacious And many unfrequented plots there are Fitted by kind for rape and villainy Single you thither then this dainty doe And strike her home by force if not by words This way or not at all stand you in hope Come come our empress with her sacred wit To villainy and vengeance consecrate Will we acquaint with all what we intend And she shall file our engines with advice That will not suffer you to square yourselves But to your wishes height advance you both The emperors court is like the house of Fame The palace full of tongues of eyes and ears The woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull There speak and strike brave boys and take your turns There serve your lust shadowed from heavens eye And revel in Lavinias treasury CHIRON Thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice DEMETRIUS Sit fas aut nefas till I find the stream To cool this heat a charm to calm these fits Per Stygia per manes vehor Exeunt SCENE II A Forest near Rome a Lodge seen at a distance Horns and cry of hounds heard Enter Titus Andronicus and his three sons and Marcus making a noise with hounds and horns TITUS The hunt is up the morn is bright and grey The fields are fragrant and the woods are green Uncouple here and let us make a bay And wake the emperor and his lovely bride And rouse the prince and ring a hunters peal That all the court may echo with the noise Sons let it be your charge as it is ours To attend the emperors person carefully I have been troubled in my sleep this night But dawning day new comfort hath inspired Here a cry of hounds and wind horns in a peal Then enter Saturninus Tamora Bassianus Lavinia Chiron Demetrius and their Attendants Many good morrows to your majesty Madam to you as many and as good I promised your grace a hunters peal SATURNINUS And you have rung it lustily my lords Somewhat too early for newmarried ladies BASSIANUS Lavinia how say you LAVINIA I say no I have been broad awake two hours and more SATURNINUS Come on then horse and chariots let us have And to our sport To Tamora Madam now shall ye see Our Roman hunting MARCUS I have dogs my lord Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase And climb the highest promontory top TITUS And I have horse will follow where the game Makes way and run like swallows oer the plain DEMETRIUS Chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground Exeunt SCENE III A lonely part of the Forest Enter Aaron alone carrying a bag of gold AARON He that had wit would think that I had none To bury so much gold under a tree And never after to inherit it Let him that thinks of me so abjectly Know that this gold must coin a stratagem Which cunningly effected will beget A very excellent piece of villainy And so repose sweet gold for their unrest That have their alms out of the empress chest He hides the bag Enter Tamora alone to the Moor TAMORA My lovely Aaron wherefore lookst thou sad When everything doth make a gleeful boast The birds chant melody on every bush The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind And make a chequered shadow on the ground Under their sweet shade Aaron let us sit And whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds Replying shrilly to the welltuned horns As if a double hunt were heard at once Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise And after conflict such as was supposed The wandring prince and Dido once enjoyed When with a happy storm they were surprised And curtained with a counselkeeping cave We may each wreathed in the others arms Our pastimes done possess a golden slumber Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds Be unto us as is a nurses song Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep AARON Madam though Venus govern your desires Saturn is dominator over mine What signifies my deadlystanding eye My silence and my cloudy melancholy My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls Even as an adder when she doth unroll To do some fatal execution No madam these are no venereal signs Vengeance is in my heart death in my hand Blood and revenge are hammering in my head Hark Tamora the empress of my soul Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee This is the day of doom for Bassianus His Philomel must lose her tongue today Thy sons make pillage of her chastity And wash their hands in Bassianus blood Seest thou this letter Take it up I pray thee And give the king this fatalplotted scroll Now question me no more we are espied Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty Which dreads not yet their lives destruction Enter Bassianus and Lavinia TAMORA Ah my sweet Moor sweeter to me than life AARON No more great empress Bassianus comes Be cross with him and Ill go fetch thy sons To back thy quarrels whatsoeer they be Exit BASSIANUS Who have we here Romes royal empress Unfurnished of her wellbeseeming troop Or is it Dian habited like her Who hath abandoned her holy groves To see the general hunting in this forest TAMORA Saucy controller of my private steps Had I the power that some say Dian had Thy temples should be planted presently With horns as was Actaeons and the hounds Should drive upon thy newtransformed limbs Unmannerly intruder as thou art LAVINIA Under your patience gentle empress Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning And to be doubted that your Moor and you Are singled forth to try experiments Jove shield your husband from his hounds today Tis pity they should take him for a stag BASSIANUS Believe me queen your swarthy Cimmerian Doth make your honour of his bodys hue Spotted detested and abominable Why are you sequestered from all your train Dismounted from your snowwhite goodly steed And wandered hither to an obscure plot Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor If foul desire had not conducted you LAVINIA And being intercepted in your sport Great reason that my noble lord be rated For sauciness I pray you let us hence And let her joy her ravencoloured love This valley fits the purpose passing well BASSIANUS The king my brother shall have notice of this LAVINIA Ay for these slips have made him noted long Good king to be so mightily abused TAMORA Why I have patience to endure all this Enter Chiron and Demetrius DEMETRIUS How now dear sovereign and our gracious mother Why doth your highness look so pale and wan TAMORA Have I not reason think you to look pale These two have ticed me hither to this place A barren detested vale you see it is The trees though summer yet forlorn and lean Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe Here never shines the sun here nothing breeds Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven And when they showed me this abhorred pit They told me here at dead time of the night A thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes Ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins Would make such fearful and confused cries As any mortal body hearing it Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly No sooner had they told this hellish tale But straight they told me they would bind me here Unto the body of a dismal yew And leave me to this miserable death And then they called me foul adulteress Lascivious Goth and all the bitterest terms That ever ear did hear to such effect And had you not by wondrous fortune come This vengeance on me had they executed Revenge it as you love your mothers life Or be ye not henceforth called my children DEMETRIUS This is a witness that I am thy son Stabs Bassianus CHIRON And this for me struck home to show my strength Also stabs Bassianus who dies LAVINIA Ay come Semiramis nay barbarous Tamora For no name fits thy nature but thy own TAMORA Give me thy poniard you shall know my boys Your mothers hand shall right your mothers wrong DEMETRIUS Stay madam here is more belongs to her First thrash the corn then after burn the straw This minion stood upon her chastity Upon her nuptial vow her loyalty And with that painted hope braves your mightiness And shall she carry this unto her grave CHIRON And if she do I would I were an eunuch Drag hence her husband to some secret hole And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust TAMORA But when ye have the honey ye desire Let not this wasp outlive us both to sting CHIRON I warrant you madam we will make that sure Come mistress now perforce we will enjoy That nicepreserved honesty of yours LAV"

time that Romeo Come to redeem me Theres a fearful point Shall I not then be stifled in the vault To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes Or if I live is it not very like The horrible conceit of death and night Together with the terror of the place As in a vault an ancient receptacle Where for this many hundred years the bones Of all my buried ancestors are packd Where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth Lies festering in his shroud where as they say At some hours in the night spirits resort Alack alack is it not like that I So early waking what with loathsome smells And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth That living mortals hearing them run mad O if I wake shall I not be distraught Environed with all these hideous fears

is proud nor the soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness ROSALIND A traveller By my faith you have great

it was Hero of Sestos But these are all lies Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love ORLANDO I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind for I protest her frown

discharge the money BASSANIO Yes here I tender it for him in the court Yea twice the sum if that will not suffice I will be bound to pay it ten times oer On forfeit of my hands my head my heart If this will not suffice it must appear That malice bears down truth And I beseech you Wrest once the law to your authority To do a great right do a little wrong And curb this cruel devil of his will PORTIA It must not be there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established Twill be recorded for a precedent And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state It cannot be SHYLOCK A Daniel come to judgment Yea a Daniel O wise young judge how I do honour thee PORTIA I pray you let me look upon the bond SHYLOCK Here tis most reverend doctor here it is PORTIA Shylock theres thrice

pound of flesh to be by him cut off Nearest the merchants heart Be merciful Take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond SHYLOCK When it is paid according to the tenour It doth appear you are a worthy judge You know the law your exposition Hath been most sound I charge you by the law Whereof you are a welldeserving pillar Proceed to judgment By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me I stay here on my bond ANTONIO Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment PORTIA Why then thus it is You must prepare your bosom for his knife SHYLOCK O noble judge O excellent young man PORTIA For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty Which here appeareth due upon the bond SHYLOCK Tis very true O wise and upright judge How much more

half Comes to the privy coffer of the state And the offenders life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only gainst all other voice In which predicament I say thou standst For it appears by manifest proceeding That indirectly and directly too Thou hast contrived against the very life Of the defendant and thou hast incurrd The danger formerly by me rehearsd Down therefore and beg mercy of the Duke GRATIANO Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state Thou hast not left the value of a cord Therefore thou must be hangd at the states charge DUKE That

fine PORTIA Ay for the state not for Antonio SHYLOCK Nay take my life and all pardon not that You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house you take my life When you do take the means whereby I live PORTIA What mercy can you render him Antonio GRATIANO A halter gratis nothing else for Gods sake ANTONIO So please my lord the Duke and all the court To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content so he will let me have The other half in use to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter Two things provided more that for this favour

Salarino and Solanio ANTONIO In sooth I know not why I am so sad It wearies me you say it wearies you But how I caught it found it or came by it What stuff tis made of whereof it is born I am to learn And such a wantwit sadness makes of me That I have much ado to know myself SALARINO Your mind is tossing on the ocean There where your argosies with portly sail Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood Or as it were the pageants of the sea Do overpeer the petty traffickers That curtsy to them do them reverence As they fly by them with their woven wings SOLANIO Believe me sir had I such venture forth The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad SALARINO My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea I should not see the sandy hourglass run But I should think of shallows and of flats And see my wealthy Andrew dockd in sand Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks Which touching but my gentle vessels side Would scatter all her spices on the stream Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks And in a word but even now worth this And now worth nothing Shall I have the thought To think on this and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechancd would make me sad But tell not me I know Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise ANTONIO Believe me no I thank my fortune for it My ventures are not in one bottom trusted Nor to one place nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad SALARINO Why then you are in love ANTONIO Fie fie SALARINO Not in love neither Then let us say you are sad Because you are not

play a part And mine a sad one GRATIANO Let me play the fool With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster Sleep when he wakes And creep into the jaundice By being peevish I tell thee what Antonio I love thee and tis my love that speaks There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond And do a wilful stillness entertain With purpose to be dressd in an opinion Of wisdom gravity profound conceit As who should say I am Sir Oracle And when I ope my lips let no dog bark O my Antonio I do know of these That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing when I am very sure If they should speak would almost damn those ears Which hearing them would call their brothers fools Ill tell thee more of this another time But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon this opinion Come good Lorenzo Fare ye well a while Ill end my exhortation after dinner LORENZO Well we will leave you then till dinnertime I must be one of these same dumb wise men For Gratiano never lets me speak GRATIANO

In a neats tongue dried and a maid not vendible Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo ANTONIO Is that anything now BASSANIO Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all Venice His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search ANTONIO Well tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage That you today promisd to tell me of BASSANIO Tis not unknown to you Antonio How much I have disabled mine estate By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance Nor do I now make moan to be abridgd From such a noble rate but my chief care Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time something too prodigal Hath left me gagd To you Antonio I owe the most in money and in love And from your love I have a warranty To unburden all my plots and purposes How to get clear of all the debts I owe ANTONIO I pray you good Bassanio let me know it And if it stand as you yourself still do Within the eye of honour be assurd My purse my person my extremest means Lie all unlockd to your occasions BASSANIO In my schooldays when I had lost one shaft I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight The selfsame way with more advised watch To find the other forth and by adventuring both I oft found both I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence I owe you much and like a wilful youth That which I owe is lost But if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first I do not doubt As I will watch the aim or to find both Or bring your latter hazard back again And thankfully rest debtor for the first ANTONIO You know me well and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done And I am prest unto it Therefore speak BASSANIO In Belmont is a lady richly left And she is fair and fairer than that word Of wondrous virtues Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages Her name is Portia nothing undervalud To Catos daughter Brutus Portia Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos strond And many Jasons come in quest of her O my Antonio had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them I have a mind presages me such thrift That I should questionless be fortunate ANTONIO Thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum therefore go forth Try what my credit can in Venice do That shall be rackd even to the uttermost To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia Go presently inquire and so will I Where money is and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake Exeunt SCENE II Belmont A room in Portias house Enter Portia with her waitingwoman Nerissa PORTIA By my troth Nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world NERISSA You would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are And yet for aught I see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing It is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean Superfluity come sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer PORTIA Good sentences and well pronouncd NERISSA They would be better if well followed PORTIA If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor mens cottages princes palaces It is a good divine that follows his own instructions I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching The brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps oer a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip oer the meshes of good counsel the cripple But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband O me the word choose I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbd by the will of a dead father Is it not hard Nerissa that I cannot choose one nor refuse none NERISSA Your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations Therefore the lottry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely"

ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threatening clouds But never till tonight never till now Did I go through a tempest dropping fire Either there is a civil strife in heaven Or else the world too saucy with the gods Incenses them to send destruction CICERO Why saw you anything more wonderful CASCA A common slave youd know him well by sight Held up his left hand which did flame and burn Like twenty torches joind and yet his hand Not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd Besides I ha not since put up my sword Against the Capitol I met a lion Who glared upon me and went surly by Without annoying me And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women Transformed with their fear who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noonday upon the marketplace Hooting and shrieking When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet let not men say These are their reasons they are natural For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon CICERO Indeed it is a strangedisposed time But men may construe things after their fashion Clean from the purpose of the things themselves Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow CASCA He doth for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow CICERO Goodnight then Casca this disturbed sky Is not to walk in CASCA Farewell Cicero Exit Cicero Enter Cassius CASSIUS Whos there CASCA A Roman CASSIUS Casca by your voice CASCA Your ear is good Cassius what night is this CASSIUS A very pleasing night to honest men CASCA Who ever knew the heavens menace so CASSIUS Those that have known the earth so full of faults For my part I have walkd about the streets Submitting me unto the perilous night And thus unbraced Casca as you see Have bard my bosom to the thunderstone And when the cross blue lightning seemd to open The breast of heaven I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it CASCA But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heavens It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us CASSIUS You are dull Casca and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want Or else you use not You look pale and gaze And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the Heavens But if you would consider the true cause Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts Why birds and beasts from quality and kind Why old men fools and children calculate Why all these things change from their ordinance Their natures and preformed faculties To monstrous quality why you shall find That Heaven hath infusd them with these spirits To make them instruments of fear and warning Unto some monstrous state Now could I Casca name to thee a man Most like this dreadful night That thunders lightens opens graves and roars As doth the lion in the Capitol A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action yet prodigious grown And fearful as these strange eruptions are CASCA Tis Caesar that you mean is it not Cassius CASSIUS Let it be who it is for Romans now Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors But woe the while our fathers minds are dead And we are governd with our mothers spirits Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish CASCA Indeed they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy CASSIUS I know where I will wear this dagger then Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius Therein ye gods you make the weak most strong Therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat Nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass Nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit But life being weary of these worldly bars Never lacks power to dismiss itself If I know this know all the world besides That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure Thunder still CASCA So can I So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity CASSIUS And why should Caesar be a tyrant then Poor man I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep He were no lion were not Romans hinds Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws What trash is Rome What rubbish and what offal when it serves For the base matter to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar But O grief Where hast thou led me I perhaps speak this Before a willing bondman then I know My answer must be made but I am armd And dangers are to me indifferent CASCA You speak to Casca and to such a man That is no fleering telltale Hold my hand Be factious for redress of all these griefs And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest CASSIUS Theres a bargain made Now know you Casca I have movd already Some certain of the noblestminded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honourabledangerous consequence And I do know by this they stay for me In Pompeys Porch for now this fearful night There is no stir or walking in the streets And the complexion of the element In favours like the work we have in hand Most bloody fiery and most terrible Enter Cinna CASCA Stand close awhile for here comes one in haste CASSIUS Tis Cinna I do know him by his gait He is a friend Cinna where haste you so CINNA To find out you Whos that Metellus Cimber CASSIUS No it is Casca one incorporate To our attempts Am I not stayd for Cinna CINNA I am glad ont What a fearful night is this Theres two or three of us have seen strange sights CASSIUS Am I not stayd for tell me CINNA Yes you are O Cassius if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party CASSIUS Be you content Good Cinna take this paper And look you lay it in the praetors chair Where Brutus may but find it and throw this In at his window set this up with wax Upon old Brutus statue all this done Repair to Pompeys Porch where you shall find us Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there CINNA All but Metellus Cimber and hes gone To seek you at your house Well I will hie And so bestow these papers as you bade me CASSIUS That done repair to Pompeys theatre Exit Cinna Come Casca you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house three parts of him Is ours already and the man entire Upon the next encounter yields him ours CASCA O he sits high in all the peoples hearts And that which would appear offence in us His countenance like richest alchemy Will change to virtue and to worthiness CASSIUS Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited Let us go For it is after midnight and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him Exeunt ACT II SCENE I Rome Brutus orchard Enter Brutus BRUTUS What Lucius ho I cannot by the progress of the stars Give guess how near to dayLucius I say I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly When Lucius when Awake I say What Lucius Enter Lucius LUCIUS Calld you my lord BRUTUS Get me a taper in my study Lucius When it is lighted come and call me here LUCIUS I will my lord Exit BRUTUS It must be by his death and for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him But for the general He would be crownd How that might change his nature theres the question It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking Crown himthat And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with Th abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power and to speak truth of Caesar I have not known when his affections swayd More than his reason But tis a common proof That lowliness is young ambitions ladder Whereto the climberupward turns his face But when he once attains the upmost round He then unto the ladder turns his back Looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend So Caesar may Then lest he may prevent And since the quarrel Will bear no colour for the thing he is Fashion it thus that what he is augmented Would run to these and these extremities And therefore think him as a serpents egg Which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous And kill him in the shell Enter Lucius LUCIUS The taper burneth in your closet sir Searching the window for a flint I found This paper thus seald up and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed Gives him the letter BRUTUS Get you to bed again it is not day Is not tomorrow boy the Ides of March LUCIUS I know not sir BRUTUS Look in the calendar and bring me word LUCIUS I will sir Exit BRUTUS The exhalations whizzing in the air Give so much light that I may read by them Opens the letter and reads Brutus thou sleepst awake and see thyself Shall Rome c Speak strike redress Brutus thou sleepst awake Such instigations have been often droppd Where I have took them up Shall Rome c Thus must I piece it out Shall Rome stand under one mans awe What Rome My ancestors did from the streets of Rome The Tarquin drive when he was calld a king Speak strike redress Am I entreated To speak and strike O Rome I make thee promise If the redress will follow thou receivest Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus Enter Lucius LUCIUS Sir March is wasted fifteen days Knock within BRUTUS Tis good Go to the gate somebody knocks Exit Lucius Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar I have not slept Between the acting of a dreadful thing And the first motion all the interim is Like a phantasma or a hideous dream The genius and the mortal instruments Are then in council and the state of man Like to a little kingdom suffers then The nature of an insurrection Enter Lucius LUCIUS Sir tis your brother Cassius at the door Who doth desire to see you BRUTUS Is he alone LUCIUS No sir there are moe with him BRUTUS Do you know them LUCIUS No sir their hats are pluckd about their ears And half their faces buried in their cloaks That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favour BRUTUS Let em enter Exit Lucius They are the faction O conspiracy Shamst thou to show thy dangerous brow by night When evils are most free O then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage Seek none conspiracy Hide it in smiles and affability For if thou path thy native semblance on Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from prevention Enter Cassius Casca Decius Cinna Metellus Cimber and Trebonius CASSIUS I think we are too bold upon your rest Good morrow Brutus do we trouble you BRUTUS I have been up this hour awake all night Know I these men that come along with you CASSIUS Yes every man of them and no man here But honours you and everyone doth wish You had but that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman bears of you This is Trebonius BRUTUS He is welcome hither CASSIUS This Decius Brutus BRUTUS He is welcome too CASSIUS This Casca this Cinna and this Metellus Cimber BRUTUS They are all welcome What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night CASSIUS Shall I entreat a word They whisper DECIUS Here lies the east doth not the day break here CASCA No CINNA O pardon sir it doth and yon grey lines That fret the clouds are messengers of day CASCA You shall confess that you are both deceivd Here as I point my sword the Sun arises Which is a great way growing on the South Weighing the youthful season of the year Some two months hence up higher toward the North He first presents his fire and the high East Stands as the Capitol directly here BRUTUS Give me your hands all over one by one CASSIUS And let us swear our resolution BRUTUS No not an oath If not the face of men The sufferance of our souls the times abuse If these be motives weak break off betimes And every man hence to his idle bed So let highsighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery But if these As I am sure they do bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valour The melting spirits of women then countrymen What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress what other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter and what other oath Than honesty to honesty engagd That this shall be or we will fall for it Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt but do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise Nor th insuppressive mettle of our spirits To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath when every drop of blood That every Roman bears and nobly bears Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passd from him CASSIUS But what of Cicero Shall we sound him I think he will stand very strong with us CASCA Let us not leave him out CINNA No by no means METELLUS O let us have him for his

One of Lord Timons men A gift I warrant Why this hits right I dreamt of a silver basin and ewer tonightFlaminius honest Flaminius you are very respectively welcome sir Fill me some wine Exit Servant And how does that honourable complete freehearted gentleman of Athens thy very bountiful good lord and master FLAMINIUS His health is well sir LUCULLUS I am right glad that his health is well sir And what hast thou there under thy cloak pretty Flaminius FLAMINIUS Faith nothing but an empty box sir which in my lords behalf I come to entreat your honour to supply who having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents hath sent to your lordship to furnish him nothing doubting your present assistance therein LUCULLUS La la la la Nothing doubting says he Alas good lord A noble gentleman tis if he would not keep so good a house Many a time and often I ha dined with him and told him ont and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less and yet he would embrace no counsel take no warning by my coming Every man has his fault and honesty is his I ha told him ont but I could neer get him from t Enter Servant with wine SERVANT Please your lordship here is the wine LUCULLUS Flaminius I have noted thee always wise Heres to thee FLAMINIUS Your lordship speaks your pleasure LUCULLUS I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit give thee thy due and one that knows what belongs to reason and canst use the time well if the time use thee well Good parts in thee To Servant Get you gone sirrah Exit Servant Draw nearer honest Flaminius Thy lords a bountiful gentleman but thou art wise and thou knowst well enough although thou comst to me that this is no time to lend money especially upon bare friendship without security Heres three solidares for thee Good boy wink at me and say thou sawst me not Fare thee well FLAMINIUS Ist possible the world should so much differ And we alive that lived Fly damned baseness To him that worships thee Throws the money back LUCULLUS Ha Now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy master Exit FLAMINIUS May these add to the number that may scald thee Let molten coin be thy damnation Thou disease of a friend and not himself Has friendship such a faint and milky heart It turns in less than two nights O you gods I feel my masters passion This slave Unto his honour has my lords meat in him Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment When he is turned to poison O may diseases only work upont And when hes sick to death let not that part of nature Which my lord paid for be of any power To expel sickness but prolong his hour Exit SCENE II A public place Enter Lucius with three Strangers LUCIUS Who the Lord Timon He is my very good friend and an honourable gentleman FIRST STRANGER We know him for no less though we are but strangers to him But I can tell you one thing my lord and which I hear from common rumours now Lord Timons happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from him LUCIUS Fie no do not believe it he cannot want for money SECOND STRANGER But believe you this my lord that not long ago one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents nay urged extremely fort and showed what necessity belonged tot and yet was denied LUCIUS How SECOND STRANGER I tell you denied my lord LUCIUS What a strange case was that Now before the gods I am ashamed ont Denied that honourable man There was very little honour showed int For my own part I must needs confess I have received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels and such like trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he mistook him and sent to me I should neer have denied his occasion so many talents Enter Servilius SERVILIUS See by good hap yonders my lord I have sweat to see his honour To Lucius My honoured lord LUCIUS Servilius You are kindly met sir Fare thee well Commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friend SERVILIUS May it please your honour my lord hath sent LUCIUS Ha What has he sent I am so much endeared to that lord hes ever sending How shall I thank him thinkest thou And what has he sent now SERVILIUS Has only sent his present occasion now my lord requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents LUCIUS I know his lordship is but merry with me He cannot want fiftyfive hundred talents SERVILIUS But in the meantime he wants less my lord If his occasion were not virtuous I should not urge it half so faithfully LUCIUS Dost thou speak seriously Servilius SERVILIUS Upon my soul tis true sir LUCIUS What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time when I might ha shown myself honourable How unluckily it happened that I should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honour Servilius now before the gods I am not able to dothe more beast I sayI was sending to use Lord Timon myself these gentlemen can witness but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done it now Commend me bountifully to his good lordship and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because I have no power to be kind And tell him this from me I count it one of my greatest afflictions say that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman Good Servilius will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him SERVILIUS Yes sir I shall LUCIUS Ill look you out a good turn Servilius Exit Servilius True as you said Timon is shrunk indeed And he thats once denied will hardly speed Exit FIRST STRANGER Do you observe this Hostilius SECOND STRANGER Ay too well FIRST STRANGER Why this is the worlds soul and just of the same piece Is every flatterers spirit Who can call him his friend That dips in the same dish For in my knowing Timon has been this lords father And kept his credit with his purse Supported his estate nay Timons money Has paid his men their wages He neer drinks But Timons silver treads upon his lip And yetO see the monstrousness of man When he looks out in an ungrateful shape He does deny him in respect of his What charitable men afford to beggars THIRD STRANGER Religion groans at it FIRST STRANGER For mine own part I never tasted Timon in my life Nor came any of his bounties over me To mark me for his friend Yet I protest For his right noble mind illustrious virtue And honourable carriage Had his necessity made use of me I would have put my wealth into donation And the best half should have returned to him So much I love his heart But I perceive Men must learn now with pity to dispense For policy sits above conscience Exeunt SCENE III The same A room in Sempronius house Enter a Third Servant of Timons with Sempronius another of Timons friends SEMPRONIUS Must he needs trouble me int Hum Bove all others He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus And now Ventidius is wealthy too Whom he redeemed from prison All these Owe their estates unto him SERVANT My lord They have all been touched and found base metal For they have all denied him SEMPRONIUS How Have they denied him Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him And does he send to me Three Humh It shows but little love or judgment in him Must I be his last refuge His friends like physicians Thrive give him over Must I take th cure upon me Has much disgraced me int Im angry at him That might have known my place I see no sense fort But his occasions might have wooed me first For in my conscience I was the first man That eer received gift from him And does he think so backwardly of me now That Ill requite it last No So it may prove an argument of laughter To th rest and I mongst lords be thought a fool Id rather than the worth of thrice the sum Had sent to me first but for my minds sake Id such a courage to do him good But now return And with their faint reply this answer join Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin Exit SERVANT Excellent Your lordships a goodly villain The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic he crossed himself byt and I cannot think but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear How fairly this lord strives to appear foul Takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire Of such a nature is his politic love This was my lords best hope now all are fled Save only the gods Now his friends are dead Doors that were neer acquainted with their wards Many a bounteous year must be employed Now to guard sure their master And this is all a liberal course allows Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house Exit SCENE IV A hall in Timons house Enter two of Varros Servants meeting Titus and Hortensius and then Lucius all Servants of Timons creditors to wait for his coming out FIRST VARROS SERVANT Well met good morrow Titus and Hortensius TITUS The

Philotus too PHILOTUS Good day at once LUCIUS Welcome good brother What do you think the hour PHILOTUS Labouring for nine LUCIUS So much PHILOTUS Is not my lord seen yet LUCIUS Not yet PHILOTUS I wonder ont he was wont to shine at seven LUCIUS Ay but the days are waxed shorter with him You must consider that a prodigal course Is like the suns but not like his recoverable I fear tis deepest winter in Lord Timons purse That is one may reach deep enough and yet Find little PHILOTUS I am of your fear for that TITUS Ill show you how t observe a strange event Your lord sends now for money HORTENSIUS Most true he does TITUS And he wears jewels now of Timons gift For which I wait for money HORTENSIUS It is against my heart LUCIUS Mark how strange it shows Timon in this should pay more than he owes And een as if your lord should wear rich jewels And send for money for em HORTENSIUS Im weary of this charge the gods can witness I know my lord hath spent of Timons wealth And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth FIRST VARROS SERVANT Yes mines three thousand crowns Whats yours LUCIUS Five thousand mine FIRST VARROS SERVANT Tis much deep and it should seem by th sum Your masters confidence was above mine Else surely his had equalled Enter Flaminius TITUS One of Lord Timons men LUCIUS Flaminius Sir a word Pray is my lord ready to come forth FLAMINIUS No indeed he is not TITUS We attend his lordship pray signify so much FLAMINIUS I need not tell him that he knows you are too diligent Exit Flaminius Enter Flavius in a cloak muffled LUCIUS Ha is not that his steward muffled so He goes away in a cloud Call him call him TITUS Do you hear sir SECOND VARROS SERVANT By your leave sir FLAVIUS What do you ask of me my friend TITUS We wait for certain money here sir FLAVIUS Ay If money were as certain as your waiting Twere sure enough Why then preferred you not your sums and bills When your false masters eat of my lords meat Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts And take down th interest into their gluttonous maws You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up Let me pass quietly Believet my lord and I have made an end I have no more to reckon he to spend LUCIUS Ay but this answer will not serve FLAVIUS If twill not serve tis not so base as you For you serve knaves Exit FIRST VARROS SERVANT How What does his cashiered worship mutter SECOND VARROS SERVANT No matter what hes poor and thats revenge enough Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in Such may rail against great buildings Enter Servilius TITUS O heres Servilius now we shall know some answer SERVILIUS If I might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other hour I should derive much fromt For taket of my soul my lord leans wondrously to discontent His comfortable temper has forsook him hes much out of health and keeps his chamber LUCIUS Many do keep their chambers are not sick And if it be so far beyond his health Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts And make a clear way to the gods SERVILIUS Good gods TITUS We cannot take this for answer sir FLAMINIUS Within Servilius help My lord my lord Enter Timon in a rage TIMON What are my doors opposed against my passage Have I been ever free and must my house Be my retentive enemy my jail The place which I have feasted does it now Like all mankind show me an iron heart LUCIUS Put in now Titus TITUS My lord here is my bill LUCIUS Heres mine HORTENSIUS And mine my lord BOTH VARROS SERVANTS And ours my lord PHILOTUS All our bills TIMON Knock me down with em Cleave me to the girdle

Richard RICHARD I have been studying how I may compare This prison where I live unto the world And for because the world is populous And here is not a creature but myself I cannot do it Yet Ill hammer it out My brain Ill prove the female to my soul My soul the father and these two beget A generation of stillbreeding thoughts And these same thoughts people this little world In humours like the people of this world For no thought is contented The better sort As thoughts of things divine are intermixed With scruples and do set the word itself Against the word as thus Come little ones And then again It is as hard to come as for a camel To thread the postern of a needles eye Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails May tear a passage through the flinty ribs Of this hard world my ragged prison walls And for they cannot die in their own pride Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves That they are not the first of fortunes slaves Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame That many have and others must sit there And in this thought they find a kind of ease Bearing their own misfortunes on the back Of such as have before endured the like Thus play I in one person many people And none contented Sometimes am I king Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar And so I am Then crushing penury Persuades me I was better when a king Then am I kinged again and by and by Think that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke And straight am nothing But whateer I be Nor I nor any man that but man is

lives And here have I the daintiness of ear To check time broke in a disordered string But for the concord of my state and time Had not an ear to hear my true time broke I wasted time and now doth time waste me For now hath time made me his numbring clock My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch Whereto my finger like a dials point Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart Which is the bell So sighs and tears and groans Show minutes times and hours But my time Runs posting on in Bolingbrokes proud joy While I stand fooling here his Jack o the clock This music mads me Let it sound no more For though it have holp madmen to their wits In me it seems it will make wise men mad Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me For tis a sign of love and love to Richard Is a strange brooch in this allhating world Enter a Groom of the stable GROOM Hail royal Prince RICHARD Thanks noble peer The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear What art thou and how comest thou hither Where no man never comes but that sad dog That brings me food to make misfortune live GROOM I was a poor groom of thy stable king When thou wert king who travelling towards York With much ado at length have gotten leave To look upon my sometimes royal masters face O how it erned my heart when I beheld In London streets that coronation day When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary That horse that thou so often hast bestrid That horse that I so carefully have dressed RICHARD Rode he on Barbary Tell me gentle friend How went he under him GROOM So proudly as if he disdained the ground RICHARD So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand This hand hath made him proud with clapping him Would he not stumble Would he not fall down Since pride must have a fall and break the neck Of that proud man that did usurp

sympathy poor Venus noteth 1057 Over one shoulder doth she hang her head Dumbly she passions franticly she doteth She thinks he could not die he is not dead 1060 Her voice is stoppd her joints forget to bow Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three And then she reprehends her mangling eye 1065 That makes more gashes where no breach should be His face seems twain each several limb is doubled For oft the eye mistakes the brain being troubled My tongue cannot express my grief for one 1069 And yet quoth she behold two Adons dead My sighs are blown away my salt tears gone Mine eyes are turnd to fire my heart to lead 1072 Heavy hearts lead melt at mine eyes red fire So shall I die by drops of hot desire Alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost What face remains alive thats worth the viewing Whose tongue is music now what canst thou boast Of things long since or anything ensuing 1078 The flowers are sweet their colours fresh and trim But true sweet beauty livd and died with him Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear 1081 Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you Having no fair to lose you need not fear The sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you But when Adonis livd sun and sharp air 1085 Lurkd like two thieves to rob him of his fair And therefore would he put his bonnet on Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep 1088 The wind would blow it off and being gone Play with his locks then would Adonis weep And straight in pity of his tender years They both would strive who first should dry his tears To see his face the lion walkd along 1093 Behind some hedge because he would not fear him To recreate himself when he hath sung The tiger would be tame and gently hear him 1096 If he had spoke the wolf would leave his prey And never fright the silly lamb that day When he beheld his shadow in the brook The fishes spread on it their golden gills 1100 When he was by the birds such pleasure took That some would sing some other in their bills Would bring him mulberries and ripered cherries He fed them with his sight they him with berries But this foul grim and urchinsnouted boar 1105 Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave Neer saw the beauteous livery that he wore Witness the entertainment that he gave 1108 If he did see his face why then I know He thought to kiss him and hath killd him so Tis true tis true thus was Adonis slain He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear 1112 Who did not whet his teeth at him again But by a kiss thought to persuade him there And nuzzling in his flank the loving swine Sheathd unaware the tusk in his soft groin 1116 Had I been toothd like him I must confess With kissing him I should have killd him first But he is dead and never did he bless My youth with his the more am I accurst 1120 With this she falleth in the place she stood And stains her face with his congealed blood She looks upon his lips and they are pale She takes him by the hand and that is cold 1124 She whispers in his ears a heavy tale As if they heard the woeful words she told She lifts the cofferlids that close his eyes Where lo two lamps burnt out in darkness lies Two glasses where herself herself beheld 1129 A thousand times and now no more reflect Their virtue lost wherein they late excelld And every beauty robbd of his effect 1132 Wonder of time quoth she this is my spite That thou being dead the day should yet be light Since thou art dead lo here I prophesy Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend 1136 It shall be waited on with jealousy Find sweet beginning but unsavoury end Neer settled equally but high or low That all loves pleasure shall not match his woe It shall be fickle false and full of fraud 1141 Bud and be blasted in a breathing while The bottom poison and the top oerstrawd With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile 1144 The strongest body shall it make most weak Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak It shall be sparing and too full of riot Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures 1148 The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet Pluck down the rich enrich the poor with treasures It shall be raging mad and silly mild Make the young old the old become a child 1152 It shall suspect where is no cause of fear It shall not fear where it should most mistrust It shall be merciful and too severe And most deceiving when it seems most just 1156 Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward Put fear to valour courage to the coward It shall be cause of war and dire events And set dissension twixt the son and sire 1160 Subject and servile to all discontents As dry combustious matter is to fire Sith in his prime death doth my love destroy They that love best their love shall not enjoy 1164 By this the boy that by her side lay killd Was melted like a vapour from her sight And in his blood that on the ground lay spilld A purple flower sprung up chequerd with white 1168 Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood She bows her head the newsprung flower to smell Comparing it to her Adonis breath 1172 And says within her bosom it shall dwell Since he himself is reft from her by death She crops the stalk and in the breach appears Greendropping sap which she compares to tears Poor flower quoth she this was thy fathers guise Sweet issue of a more sweetsmelling sire For every little grief to wet his eyes To grow unto himself was his desire 1180 And so tis thine but know it is as good To wither in my breast as in his blood Here was thy fathers bed here in my breast Thou art the next of blood and tis thy right 1184 Lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night There shall not be one minute in an hour Wherein I will not kiss my sweet loves flower Thus weary of the world away she hies 1189 And yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid Their mistress mounted through the empty skies In her light chariot quickly is conveyd 1192 Holding their course to Paphos where their queen Means to immure herself and not be seenTHE SONNETS 1 From fairest creatures we desire increase That thereby beautys rose might never die But as the riper should by time decease His tender heir might bear his memory But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes Feedst thy lights flame with selfsubstantial fuel Making a famine where abundance lies Thyself thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel Thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament And only herald to the gaudy spring Within thine own bud buriest thy content And tender churl makst waste in niggarding Pity the world or else this glutton be To eat the worlds due by the grave and thee 2 When forty winters shall besiege thy brow And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now Will be a tattered weed of small worth held Then being asked where all thy beauty lies Where all the treasure of thy lusty days To say within thine own deep sunken eyes Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise How much more praise deservd thy beautys use If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine Shall sum my count and make my old excuse Proving his beauty by succession thine This were to be new made when thou art old And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold 3 Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest Now is the time that face should form another Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother For where is she so fair whose uneared womb Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry Or who is he so fond will be the tomb Of his selflove to stop posterity Thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee Calls back the lovely April of her prime So thou through windows of thine age shalt see Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time But if thou live remembered not to be Die single and thine image dies with thee 4 Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend Upon thyself thy beautys legacy Natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend And being frank she lends to those are free Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse The bounteous largess given thee to give Profitless usurer why dost thou use So great a sum of sums yet canst not live For having traffic with thyself alone Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive Then how when nature calls thee to be gone What acceptable audit canst thou leave Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee Which used lives th executor to be 5 Those hours that with gentle work did frame The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell Will play the tyrants to the very same And that unfair which fairly doth excel For neverresting time leads summer on To hideous winter and confounds him there Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone Beauty oersnowed and bareness every where Then were not summers distillation left A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass Beautys effect with beauty were bereft Nor it nor no remembrance what it was But flowers distilled though they with winter meet Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet 6 Then let not winters ragged hand deface In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place With beautys treasure ere it be selfkilled That use is not forbidden usury Which happies those that pay the willing loan Thats for thyself to breed another thee Or ten times happier be it ten for one Ten times thyself were happier than thou art If ten of thine ten times refigured thee Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart Leaving thee living in posterity Be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair To be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir 7 Lo in the orient when the gracious light Lifts up his burning head each under eye Doth homage to his newappearing sight Serving with looks his sacred majesty And having climbed the steepup heavenly hill Resembling strong youth in his middle age Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still Attending on his golden pilgrimage But when from highmost pitch with weary car Like feeble age he reeleth from the day The eyes fore duteous now converted are From his low tract and look another way So thou thyself outgoing in thy noon Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son 8 Music to hear why hearst thou music sadly Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy Why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly Or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy If the true concord of welltuned sounds By unions married do offend thine ear They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear Mark how one string sweet husband to another Strikes each in each by mutual ordering Resembling sire and child and happy mother Who all in one one pleasing note do sing Whose speechless song being many seeming one Sings this to thee Thou single wilt prove none 9 Is it for fear to wet a widows eye That thou consumst thyself in single life Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die The world will wail thee like a makeless wife The world will be thy widow and still weep That thou no form of thee hast left behind When every private widow well may keep By childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it But beautys waste hath in the world an end And kept unused the user so destroys it No love toward others in that bosom sits That on himself such murdrous shame commits 10 For shame deny that thou bearst love to any Who for thyself art so unprovident Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many But that thou none lovst is most evident For thou art so possessed with murdrous hate That gainst thyself thou stickst not to conspire Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate Which to repair should be thy chief desire O change thy thought that I may change my mind Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love Be as thy presence is gracious and kind Or to thyself at least kindhearted prove Make thee another self for love of me That beauty still may live in thine or thee 11 As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst In one of thine from that which thou departest And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase Without this folly age and cold decay If all were minded so the times should cease And threescore year would make the world away Let those whom nature hath not made for store Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish Look whom she best endowed she gave thee more Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die 12 When I do count the clock that tells the time And see the brave day sunk in hideous night When I behold the violet past prime And sable curls all silvered oer with white When lofty trees I"

their trains PORTIA I pray you tarry pause a day or two Before you hazard for in choosing wrong I lose your company therefore forbear a while Theres something tells me but it is not love I would not lose you and you know yourself Hate counsels not in such a quality But lest you should not understand me well And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought I would detain you here some month or two Before you venture for me I could teach you How to choose right but then I am forsworn So will I never be So may you miss me But if you do youll make me wish a sin That I had been forsworn Beshrew your eyes They have oerlookd me and divided me One half of me is yours the other half yours Mine own I would say but if mine then yours And so all yours O these naughty times Puts bars between the owners and their rights And so though yours not yours Prove it so Let Fortune go to hell for it not I I speak too long but tis to peise the time To eche it and to draw it out in length To stay you from election BASSANIO Let me choose For as I am I live upon the rack PORTIA Upon the rack Bassanio Then confess What treason there is mingled with your love BASSANIO None but that ugly treason of mistrust Which makes me fear th enjoying of my love There may as well be amity and life Tween snow and fire as treason and my love PORTIA Ay but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforced do speak anything BASSANIO Promise me life and Ill confess the truth PORTIA Well then confess and live BASSANIO Confess and love Had been the very sum of my confession O happy torment when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance But let me to my fortune and the caskets PORTIA Away then I am lockd in one of them If you do love me you will find me out Nerissa and the rest stand all aloof Let music sound while he doth make his choice Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end Fading in music That the comparison May stand more proper my eye shall be the stream And watry deathbed for him He may win And what is music then Then music is Even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a newcrowned monarch Such it is As are those dulcet sounds in break of day That creep into the dreaming bridegrooms ear And summon him to marriage Now he goes With no less presence but with much more love Than young Alcides when he did redeem The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy To the seamonster I stand for sacrifice The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives With bleared visages come forth to view The issue of th exploit Go Hercules Live thou I live With much much more dismay I view the fight than thou that makst the fray A song whilst Bassanio comments on the caskets to himself Tell me where is fancy bred Or in the heart or in the head How begot how nourished Reply reply It is engendred in the eyes With gazing fed and fancy dies In the cradle where it lies Let us all ring fancys knell Ill begin itDing dong bell ALL Ding dong bell BASSANIO So may the outward shows be least themselves The world is still deceivd with ornament In law what plea so tainted and corrupt But being seasond with a gracious voice Obscures the show of evil In religion What damned error but some sober brow Will bless it and approve it with a text Hiding the grossness with fair ornament There is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts How many cowards whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars Who inward searchd have livers white as milk And these assume but valours excrement To render them redoubted Look on beauty And you shall see tis purchasd by the weight Which therein works a miracle in nature Making them lightest that wear most of it So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which make such wanton gambols with the wind Upon supposed fairness often known To be the dowry of a second head The skull that bred them in the sepulchre Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty in a word The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest Therefore thou gaudy gold Hard food for Midas I will none of thee Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge Tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead Which rather threatenst than dost promise aught Thy palenness moves me more than eloquence And here choose I joy be the consequence PORTIA Aside How all the other passions fleet to air As doubtful thoughts and rashembracd despair And shuddring fear and greeneyd jealousy O love be moderate allay thy ecstasy In measure rain thy joy scant this excess I feel too much thy blessing make it less For fear I surfeit BASSANIO What find I here Opening the leaden casket Fair Portias counterfeit What demigod Hath come so near creation Move these eyes Or whether riding on the balls of mine Seem they in motion Here are severd lips Parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar Should sunder such sweet friends Here in her hairs The painter plays the spider and hath woven A golden mesh tentrap the hearts of men Faster than gnats in cobwebs But her eyes How could he see to do them Having made one Methinks it should have power to steal both his And leave itself unfurnishd Yet look how far The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow In underprizing it so far this shadow Doth limp behind the substance Heres the scroll The continent and summary of my fortune You that choose not by the view Chance as fair and choose as true Since this fortune falls to you Be content and seek no new If you be well pleasd with this And hold your fortune for your bliss Turn to where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss A gentle scroll Fair lady by your leave Kissing her I come by note to give and to receive Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in peoples eyes Hearing applause and universal shout Giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt Whether those peals of praise be his or no So thricefair lady stand I even so As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirmd signd ratified by you PORTIA You see me Lord Bassanio where I stand Such as I am though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself A thousand times more fair ten thousand times More rich That only to stand high in your account I might in virtues beauties livings friends Exceed account But the full sum of me Is sum of something which to term in gross Is an unlessond girl unschoold unpractisd Happy in this she is not yet so old But she may learn happier than this She is not bred so dull but she can learn Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord her governor her king Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion master of my servants Queen oer myself and even now but now This house these servants and this same myself Are yoursmy lords I give them with this ring Which when you part from lose or give away Let it presage the ruin of your love And be my vantage to exclaim on you BASSANIO Madam you have bereft me of all words Only my blood speaks to you in my veins And there is such confusion in my powers As after some oration fairly spoke By a beloved prince there doth appear Among the buzzing pleased multitude Where every something being blent together Turns to a wild of nothing save of joy Expressd and not expressd But when this ring Parts from this finger then parts life from hence O then be bold to say Bassanios dead NERISSA My lord and lady it is now our time That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper To cry good joy Good joy my lord and lady GRATIANO My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady I wish you all the joy that you can wish For I am sure you can wish none from me And when your honours mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too BASSANIO With all my heart so thou canst get a wife GRATIANO I thank your lordship you have got me one My eyes my lord can look as swift as yours You saw the mistress I beheld the maid You lovd I lovd for intermission No more pertains to me my lord than you Your fortune stood upon the caskets there And so did mine too as the matter falls For wooing here until I sweat again And swearing till my very roof was dry With oaths of love at last if promise last I got a promise of this fair one here To have her love provided that your fortune Achievd her mistress PORTIA Is this true Nerissa NERISSA Madam it is so you stand pleasd withal BASSANIO And do you Gratiano mean good faith GRATIANO Yes faith my lord BASSANIO Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage GRATIANO Well play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats NERISSA What and stake down GRATIANO No we shall neer win at that sport and stake down But who comes here Lorenzo and his infidel What and my old Venetian friend Salerio Enter Lorenzo Jessica and Salerio BASSANIO Lorenzo and Salerio welcome hither If that the youth of my new intrest here Have power to bid you welcome By your leave I bid my very friends and countrymen Sweet Portia welcome PORTIA So do I my lord They are entirely welcome LORENZO I thank your honour For my part my lord My purpose was not to have seen you here But meeting with Salerio by the way He did entreat me past all saying nay To come with him along SALERIO I did my lord And I have reason for it Signior Antonio Commends him to you Gives Bassanio a letter BASSANIO Ere I ope his letter I pray you tell me how my good friend doth SALERIO Not sick my lord unless it be in mind Nor well unless in mind His letter there Will show you his estate Bassanio opens the letter GRATIANO Nerissa cheer yond stranger bid her welcome Your hand Salerio Whats the news from Venice How doth that royal merchant good Antonio I know he will be glad of our success We are the Jasons we have won the fleece SALERIO I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost PORTIA There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the colour from Bassanios cheek Some dear friend dead else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man What worse and worse With leave Bassanio I am half yourself And I must freely have the half of anything That this same

as she answers thee with frowning looks Ill sauce her with bitter words Why look you so upon me PHOEBE For no ill will I bear you ROSALIND I pray you do not fall in love with me For I am falser than vows made in wine Besides I like you not If you will know my house Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by Will you go sister Shepherd ply her hard Come sister Shepherdess look on him better And be not proud Though all the world could see None could be so abused in sight as he Come to our flock Exeunt Rosalind Celia and Corin PHOEBE Dead shepherd now I find thy saw of might Who ever loved that loved not at first sight SILVIUS Sweet Phoebe PHOEBE Ha what sayst thou Silvius SILVIUS Sweet Phoebe pity me PHOEBE Why I am sorry for thee gentle Silvius SILVIUS Wherever sorrow is relief would be If you do sorrow at my grief in love By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined PHOEBE Thou hast my love Is not that neighbourly SILVIUS I would have you PHOEBE Why that were covetousness Silvius the time was that I hated thee And yet it is not that I bear thee love But since that thou canst talk of love so well Thy company which erst was irksome to me I will endure and Ill employ thee too But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed SILVIUS So holy and so perfect is my love And I in such a poverty of grace That I shall think it a most plenteous crop To glean the broken ears after the man That the main harvest reaps Loose now and then A scattered smile and that Ill live upon PHOEBE Knowst thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile SILVIUS Not very well but I have met him oft And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of PHOEBE Think not I love him though I ask for him Tis but a peevish boyyet he talks well But what care I for words Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear It is a pretty youthnot very pretty But sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him Hell make a proper man The best thing in him Is his complexion and faster than his tongue Did make offence his eye did heal it up He is not very tall yet for his years hes tall His leg is but soso and yet tis well There was a pretty redness in his lip A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek Twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask There be some women Silvius had they marked him In parcels as I did would have gone near To fall in love with him but for my part I love him not nor hate him not and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him For what had he to do to chide at me He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And now I am remembered scorned at me I marvel why I answered not again But thats all one omittance is no quittance Ill write to him a very taunting letter And thou shalt bear it Wilt thou Silvius SILVIUS Phoebe with all my heart PHOEBE Ill write it straight The matters in my head and in my heart I will be bitter with him and passing short Go with me Silvius Exeunt ACT IV SCENE I The Forest of Arden Enter Rosalind Celia and Jaques JAQUES I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with thee ROSALIND They say you are a melancholy fellow JAQUES I am so I do love it better than laughing ROSALIND Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards JAQUES Why tis good to be sad and say nothing ROSALIND Why then tis good to be a post JAQUES I have neither the scholars melancholy which is emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical nor the courtiers which is proud nor the soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness ROSALIND A traveller By my faith you have great reason to be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands JAQUES Yes I have gained my experience ROSALIND And your experience makes you sad I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sadand to travel for it too Enter Orlando ORLANDO Good day and happiness dear Rosalind JAQUES Nay then God be wi you an you talk in blank verse ROSALIND Farewell Monsieur Traveller Look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola Exit Jaques Why how now Orlando where have you been all this while You a lover An you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more ORLANDO My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise ROSALIND Break an hours promise in love He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o the shoulder but Ill warrant him heartwhole ORLANDO Pardon me dear Rosalind ROSALIND Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I had as lief be wooed of a snail ORLANDO Of a snail ROSALIND Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his heada better jointure I think than you make a woman Besides he brings his destiny with him ORLANDO Whats that ROSALIND Why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife ORLANDO Virtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuous ROSALIND And I am your Rosalind CELIA It pleases him to call you so but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you ROSALIND Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent What would you say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind ORLANDO I would kiss before I spoke ROSALIND Nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lackingGod warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss ORLANDO How if the kiss be denied ROSALIND Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter ORLANDO Who could be out being before his beloved mistress ROSALIND Marry that should you if I were your mistress or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit ORLANDO What of my suit ROSALIND Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit Am not I your Rosalind ORLANDO I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her ROSALIND Well in her person I say I will not have you ORLANDO Then in mine own person I die ROSALIND No faith die by attorney The poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a lovecause Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love Leander he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos But these are all lies Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love ORLANDO I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind for I protest her frown might kill me ROSALIND By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now I will be your Rosalind in a more comingon disposition and ask me what you will I will grant it ORLANDO Then love me Rosalind ROSALIND Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all ORLANDO And wilt thou have me ROSALIND Ay and twenty such ORLANDO What sayest thou ROSALIND Are you not good ORLANDO I hope so ROSALIND Why then can one desire too much of a good"
